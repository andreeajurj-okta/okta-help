		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

You can suppress them completely, or send them to admins only. This unlocks testing scenarios which warrant using production user directories, and prevents end users from getting test emails. It also allows extensibility for customers who would like to use a third party email sender through Hooks or Workflows. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/brands/#email-template-settings">Email template settings</a>.</p>

Flows that are delegated to an admin appear on the Delegated Flows page where they can be invoked without signing in to the Workflows Console. This gives super admins more granular control over their admin assignments. See <a href="../automation-hooks/delegated-flows/about-delegated-flows.htm" class="MCXref xref">Delegated flows</a>.</p>

Dynamic routing rules use expression language to match users to any IdP, based on attributes of their login object. This reduces the volume and complexity of routing rules and the manual effort of managing them.

When this is configured, Okta only accepts SAML requests signed using the certificate associated with the app integration. Having signed SAML requests also resolves scenarios where the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL requested after authentication can be one of several domains or URLs. When a Service Provider sends a signed authentication request, Okta can accept dynamic ACS values as part of the SAML request and posts the SAML assertion response to the ACS value specified in the request.

Additionally, the Signed Request Object now also supports the use of private/public key pairs.

It works with any browser or native app that can access the certificate store when performing the federated authentication flow to Okta. This includes Edge, Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Microsoft Office clients that support Modern Authentication. Okta Device Trust for Windows provides these key benefits:Ensures that only end users on domain-joined Windows computers can seamlessly SSO into SAML and WS-Fed cloud apps
			Protects enterprise data even when there is no defined network boundaryProvides a frictionless end user experience by utilizing the Okta Certificate Authority
			Support for Device Trust enrollment in multi-forest environments.PrerequisitesClient workstationsActive Directory domain-joined Windows computer(s) running Microsoft Windows 7, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10..NET Framework version 4.5.2 and later. The Device Registration Task checks whether a supported version of .NET Framework is present, and if not, installs a supported version automatically. See Known Issues.Active Directory and IWA serversSee Manage your Active Directory integration and IWA agent documentation.IWA agentDevice Trust-capable version of the Okta IWA web agent. For installation details, see IWA documentation. Note: Device Trust enrollment in multi-forest environments requires IWA web app version 1.12.2+. An IWA web app running in one forest can detect and assess the trust posture of Windows desktop devices located in another trusted forest and then allow these devices to enroll in Device Trust for Windows.Supported browsersMicrosoft Internet Explorer versions 10 and 11Microsoft Edge (current and previous release)Google Chrome (current and previous release)Before you beginWeb view must have access to the device certificate store: Okta Device Trust for Windows computers works with any SAML/WS-Fed-enabled app that supports authentication through a webview. The web view in which authentication is performed must have access to the certificate store on the device. This includes Microsoft Office clients that support Modern Authentication, among others. See the Microsoft article Updated Office 365 modern authentication.  Device + end user authentication requires a network connection: For the IWA web app to authenticate end users and devices, end users must be logged-in to your company's network at the time the Device Registration Task runs. See IWA web app.Device Trust enrollment is not supported when Okta is in read-only mode: Devices  cannot be enrolled in Device Trust if the cell in which your Okta org resides is in read-only mode.Support for proxy server environments: To ensure that this device trust solution works in environments that implement a proxy server, you must install Device Registration Task version 1.2.1 or higher through a command line and append the appropriate HttpProxy parameter to the installation command. See Install the Registration Task.Make sure that certificates are installed on targeted computers: Before you configure the Trusted option for apps in App Sign On Policy rules, you must make sure that certificates are installed in the certificate store on the domain-joined computers you have targeted for this Device Trust solution. If certificates are not installed and the Trusted setting is enabled, users are denied access to the app and are redirected to a security message advising them to contact their administrator. (You can configure the message to include a Learn more link to more information. See Enable the global Device Trust setting for your org). To verify certificate enrollment, Okta recommends that you use your management tool to parse the Windows Event Viewer, or use a command line to query the user certificate store directly. Look for Okta MTLS certificate.Take care when disabling the Windows Device Trust setting: Don't disable the Windows Device Trust setting on the Security &gt; Device Trust page if you have also configured an app sign-on policy that allows trusted Windows devices. Otherwise, your Device Trust configuration will be in an inconsistent state and users with untrusted devices won't be shown the security message advising them to contact their administrator, nor the Learn more link to more information (if configured; see Enable the global Device Trust setting for your org).Before asking Okta Support to disable Okta Device Trust for Windows: First make sure to change the Device Trust setting in the app sign-on policy rules to Any (Applications &gt; app &gt; Sign On). If you do not make this change and then later have Okta Support re-enable Device Trust capability for your org, the Device Trust setting in app sign-on policy rules will take effect immediately, which you may not have expected.To verify installation of the Registration Task, use an appropriate detection setting: After installing the Device Registration Task on your managed Windows computers, SCCM runs a script  to verify that installation was successful. Make sure to specify either File System or Registry in your Detection Rule. Don't use the Windows Installer setting type to detect the installation, as SCCM cannot detect the Device Registration Task using that setting. Ensure clients can complete the MTLS handshake:  If your org implements proxy servers/proxy clients or endpoint protection software, make sure to configure them in a way that doesn't block the Mutual TLS certificate exchange (handshake) that occurs during this Device Trust flow. See Troubleshooting.Shared-terminal scenarios not supported: Okta Device Trust for Windows doesn't support shared-terminal scenarios in which multiple end users log in to the same domain-joined workstation.Apps secured by Device Trust are shown as locked on the Okta End-User Dashboard. A lock icon is shown beside apps secured by Device Trust under these conditions: &#160;The end users accessed the dashboard in a desktop or mobile browser (not in Okta Mobile). Device Trust is enabled for the org.The device is not trusted.The end user tried to access any Device Trust-secured app from their dashboard. ProceduresThese procedures have three main steps:Step 1. Enable the global Device Trust setting for your orgDo not disable the Windows Device Trust setting on the Security &gt; Device Trust page if you have also configured an app sign-on policy that allows trusted Windows devices. Otherwise, your Device Trust configuration will be in an inconsistent state and users with untrusted devices won't be shown the security message advising them to contact their administrator, nor the Learn more link to more information (if configured; see Enable the global Device Trust setting for your org).In the Admin Console, go to Security &gt; Device Trust.In the Windows Device Trust section, click Edit.Select Enable Windows Device Trust.Optional. In the Learn more link field, you can enter an externally-accessible redirect URL where end users with untrusted devices can find more information. The security message shown to these end users will include a Learn more link that redirects to your specified URL.
							If you choose not to specify a URL in this optional field, these end users are shown the same message but without the Learn more link.Click Save.Proceed to Step 2.Step 2.  Enroll the Device Trust certificate on domain-joined Windows computersPerform the four sub-procedures in this section to ensure that the Device Trust certificate is installed successfully on domain-joined Windows computers.2.1 Install a Device Trust-supported version of the Okta IWA web app in your AD domain
        Okta Device Trust for Windows uses the IWA&#160;web app to confirm the security posture of Windows computers and users by validating that both are joined to your Active Directory domain. (Enrollment is also supported in multi-forest environments. See Prerequisites.) Okta then issues a certificate to the Windows computer enabling Device Trust flows to Okta-federated apps. Private keys associated with the Okta certificate never leave the Windows computer. Certificates are renewed automatically once a year, approximately 30 days before they expire.The role of the IWA web app is limited to the certificate enrollment and renewal process. Once the certificate is installed, the Device Registration Task no longer needs to communicate with the IWA web app in order for end users to access apps. Desktop SSO doesn't need to be On in Security &gt; Delegated Authentication for Okta Device Trust for Windows desktop to function. To download the  IWA web app, configure a link as follows:https://&lt;org&gt;.&lt;okta/oktapreview&gt;.com/static/agents/iwa/OktaSsoIwa-x.x.x.exeWhere:&lt;org&gt; is the name of your org&lt;okta/oktapreview&gt; denotes either your Okta Production or Preview environment.oktaSsoIwa-x.x.x.exe is the version of the IWA web app that supports Device Trust for Windows. For the current Device Trust-capable version, see SSO IWA Web App Version History.For example, a link for downloading version 1.11.0 to the org example.oktapreview.com would look like this:https://example.oktapreview.com/static/agents/iwa/OktaSsoIwa-1.11.0.exeInstall the Okta IWA web app as detailed in Install and Configure the Okta IWA Web App for Desktop SSO.To make sure that the IWA web agent is operational, test it as described in the guide. If you use HTTPS for IWA, you must modify the IWA web.config file as follows:On the server running the IWA web agent, access the file C:\inetpub\wwwroot\IWA\web.configLocate the section &lt;system.serviceModel&gt; and replace it with the following:
                    Copy&lt;system.serviceModel&gt;&lt;bindings&gt;&lt;webHttpBinding&gt;&lt;binding name = "SecureBindingForDeviceTrust"&gt;&lt;security mode="Transport"&gt;&lt;transport clientCredentialType = "Windows" proxyCredentialType="Windows"/&gt;&lt;/security&gt;&lt;/binding&gt;&lt;binding name = "HttpBindingForDeviceTrust"&gt;&lt;security mode="TransportCredentialOnly"&gt;&lt;transport clientCredentialType = "Windows" proxyCredentialType="Windows"/&gt;&lt;/security&gt;&lt;/binding&gt;&lt;/webHttpBinding&gt;&lt;/bindings&gt;&lt;services&gt;&lt;service name="OktaSSO.DeviceTrust" behaviorConfiguration="OktaSSO.DeviceTrustBehavior"&gt;&lt;endpoint binding="webHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="SecureBindingForDeviceTrust" contract="OktaSSO.IDeviceTrust" behaviorConfiguration="webHttp"/&gt;&lt;/service&gt;&lt;/services&gt;&lt;behaviors&gt;&lt;endpointBehaviors&gt;&lt;behavior name="webHttp"&gt;&lt;webHttp/&gt;&lt;/behavior&gt;&lt;/endpointBehaviors&gt;&lt;serviceBehaviors&gt;&lt;behavior name="OktaSSO.DeviceTrustBehavior"&gt;&lt;!-- To avoid disclosing metadata information, set the value below to false before deployment --&gt;&lt;serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="false"/&gt;&lt;!-- To receive exception details in faults for debugging purposes, set the value below to true.&#160;&#160;Set to false before deployment to avoid disclosing exception information --&gt;&lt;serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="false"/&gt;&lt;serviceCredentials&gt;&lt;windowsAuthentication allowAnonymousLogons="False" includeWindowsGroups="True"/&gt;&lt;/serviceCredentials&gt;&lt;/behavior&gt;&lt;/serviceBehaviors&gt;&lt;/behaviors&gt;&lt;/system.serviceModel&gt;Here's a detailed look at the values that configure HTTP or HTTPS binding:HTTPS binding configured:Copy&lt;services&gt;&lt;service name="OktaSSO.DeviceTrust" behaviorConfiguration="OktaSSO.DeviceTrustBehavior"&gt;&lt;endpoint binding="webHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="SecureBindingForDeviceTrust" contract="OktaSSO.IDeviceTrust" behaviorConfiguration="webHttp"/&gt;&lt;/service&gt;&lt;/serviceHTTP binding configured:Copy&lt;services&gt;&lt;service name="OktaSSO.DeviceTrust" behaviorConfiguration="OktaSSO.DeviceTrustBehavior"&gt;&lt;endpoint binding="webHttpBinding" bindingConfiguration="HttpBindingForDeviceTrust" contract="OktaSSO.IDeviceTrust" behaviorConfiguration="webHttp"/&gt;&lt;endpoint address="mex" binding="mexHttpBinding" contract="IMetadataExchange" /&gt;&lt;/service&gt;&lt;/services&gt;Save and close the web.config file.From your Windows command prompt, restart Internet Information Services (IIS) by issuing the following commands:
											iisreset /stopiisreset /startBefore proceeding, retest the IWA web app as described in Install and Configure the IWA Web App for Desktop SSO.If you haven't already, install the Device Registration Task as described in Obtain and install the Device Registration Task.2.2 Obtain and install the Device Registration Task
        Important to know before you beginTrusted Platform Module (TPM) To leverage the security benefits of TPM, see Enhance Windows Device Trust security with Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Schedule the Registration Task to run when end users are on the corporate networkOnce installed on domain-joined computers, the Registration Task runs:Immediately after it is installedWhenever the user logs on to the computerOnce every 24 hours, starting with the time that the Registration Task first ran.It is important that you configure your management tool to schedule the Registration Task to run when end users are on the corporate network. When the Registration Task runs, it triggers the certificate enrollment flow and creates a Scheduled Task that will run every 24 hours and whenever the user logs on to the computer. This retry behavior helps both certificate enrollment and renewal scenarios. Automatic certificate renewal can only occur when end users are on the corporate networkCertificates are valid for one year and are renewed automatically sometime within 30 days before expiration. In order for automatic renewal to succeed, end users must be logged on to the domain-joined computer and connected to your corporate network.Manually force certificate renewalYou can manually force certificate renewal to try to fix the following problems (requires Device Registration Task 1.3.1 or later):An end user's certificate was incorrectly or accidentally revoked by the admin through the Admin Console (see Revoke).The certificate was corrupted on the client due to accidental deletion, file corruption, or loss of the  private key.See Force certificate renewal in some circumstances.Automatic certificate selectionBy default, the Registration Task configures registry keys on domain-joined Windows computers to allow supported Chrome, Edge, and IE browsers to automatically select the Device Trust certificate that will be presented to Okta. If appropriate for your environment, you can disable this behavior by adding the flag SkipBrowserSetup=true to the installation command.See Obtain the registration task. For example, this would be necessary if you want to configure automatic certificate selection using a Group Policy Object (GPO) tool.If you opt not to configure automatic certificate selection — either through the Registration Task or a GPO — end users are prompted to select the certificate when accessing the app. In that case, to make the selection easier for end users, only the Okta Device Trust certificate will be shown to them.Proxy server environmentIf your organization routes internet traffic through a proxy server, note the following:You must install Device Registration Task version 1.2.1 or higher through a command line and append the appropriate HttpProxy parameter to the installation command.
											See Install the Registration Task.If your org implements  proxy servers/proxy clients or endpoint protection software, make sure to configure them in a way that doesn't block the Mutual TLS certificate exchange (handshake) that occurs during this Device Trust flow.
											See Troubleshooting.Certificate revocationYou may need to revoke an end user's Device Trust certificate(s) from the Okta Certificate Authority. This is recommended if the computer is lost or stolen. To re-secure an end user's computer with Device Trust after revoking their certificate(s), you need to remove the Device Trust certificate from their computer before you enroll a new certificate. Certificate revocation doesn't remove existing certificates from managed Windows computers.See Revoke and remove Device Trust certificates.Use an appropriate Setting Type in SCCM to verify Device Registration Task installationAfter installing the Device Trust client on your managed Windows computers, SCCM runs a script  to verify that installation was successful. Make sure to specify either File System or Registry in your Detection Rule. Do not use the Windows Installer setting type to detect the installation, as SCCM cannot detect the Device Trust client using that setting. Obtain the Registration TaskTo leverage the security benefits of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), see Enhance Windows Device Trust security with Trusted Platform Module (TPM).To obtain an Early Access (EA) version of the Registration Task
								Unlike the GA version, EA versions of the Device Registration Task are not available from the Downloads page in the Okta Admin Console. To obtain an EA version, you must configure a link as follows:https://&lt;org&gt;.&lt;okta/oktapreview&gt;.com/static/devicetrust/OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-x.x.x.&lt;msi/exe&gt;Where:&lt;org&gt; is the name of your org&lt;okta/oktapreview&gt; denotes either your Okta Production or Preview environment.OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-x.x.x is the version of the Registration Task. For the latest version of the Registration Task, see Device Trust for Windows Desktop Registration Task Version History.&lt;msi/exe&gt; is the file type of the Registration Task, either .msi or .exe.For example, a link for downloading .msi Registration Task version 1.4.0 to example.oktapreview.com would look like this:https://example.oktapreview.com/static/devicetrust/OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.4.0.msiFor version history, see Okta Device Trust for Windows Desktop Registration Task Version History.To obtain a Generally Available (GA) version of the Registration TaskThe latest GA version of the Registration Task is available from the Downloads page in .msi and .exe formats. For version history, see Okta Device Trust for Windows Desktop Registration Task Version History.In the Admin Console, go to Settings &gt; Downloads.Scroll to Okta Device Trust for Windows Agents and then click Download Latest for the type of installer you want (.msi or .exe).Install the Registration TaskInstall the Registration Task in using either of the following methods:
									Method 1: Distribute the Registration Task using a management tool (SCCM)Follow your organization's procedure for distributing software to domain-joined workstations. If your organization uses SCCM, you may want to refer to the Microsoft article How to Deploy Applications in Configuration Manager. Execute the appropriate command for *.exe or *.msi installation.About the Device Registration Task and proxy serversIf your organization routes internet traffic through a proxy server, you must do the following:Use a command line to install the Device Registration Task and include parametersInstall Device Registration Task version 1.2.2+&#160;through a command line and append the appropriate HttpProxy parameter to the installation command. This is necessary because the Registration Task installer installs these two scheduled tasks:A user task that runs as the logged-in user.A device task that runs as a network service. If you set up your proxy server(s) as part of your Internet Explorer (IE) configuration, the device task does not detect your IE settings unless you specify that behavior through a command line as shown in the following examples.Include the parameter appropriate for your environment:Proxy server environments
HttpProxy=http://&lt;your proxy http url&gt;:&lt;port number&gt;For example, the installation command that includes the proxy server parameter would look similar to this for: MSI installation:msiexec /i OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.x.x-xxxxxxx INSTALLDIR="c:\Program Files\Okta\DeviceTrust" EXEOPTIONS="/q2 OktaURL=https://&lt;your Okta org&gt;/ HttpProxy=http://&lt;your proxy http url&gt;:&lt;port number&gt;"EXE installation:OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.0.0-XXXX.exe /q2 OktaURL=https://&lt;your-okta-org-url&gt;.com HttpProxy=http://&lt;your proxy http url&gt;:&lt;port number&gt;Make sure to add a space if you are also adding the parameter to disable automatic certificate handling.Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) environmentsA. Specify the PAC locationHttpProxyPacLocation=http://mypacfile.url.locationFor example, the installation command that includes the PAC&#160;location parameter would look similar to this for: MSI installation:msiexec /i OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.x.x-xxxxxxx INSTALLDIR="c:\Program Files\Okta\DeviceTrust" EXEOPTIONS="/q2 OktaURL=https://&lt;your Okta org&gt;/ HttpProxyPacLocation=http://mypacfile.url.location"EXE installation:OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.0.0-XXXX.exe /q2 OktaURL=https://&lt;your-okta-org-url&gt;.com HttpProxyPacLocation=http://mypacfile.url.locationMake sure to add a space if you are also adding the parameter to disable automatic certificate handling.B. Optional. Allow your Okta orgIf you implement a PAC file in your proxy environment, consider allowing your Okta org by adding an exception to the PAC file like this:if(localHostOrDomainIs(host,"*.okta.com")){ return "DIRECT"; }Ensure clients can complete the MTLS handshakeThe Mutual TLS certificate exchange (handshake) in this Device Trust flow occurs on Okta URLs that are separate from your Okta org URL (indicated by the wildcard character (*) in the following example). Make sure to configure  proxy servers/proxy clients, as well as any endpoint protection software you may implement, in a way that does not block your clients from completing the certificate exchange with Okta. For example, if your organization uses an allowlist to limit outbound traffic, add these exact URLs to the allowlist, including the wildcard character (*):*.okta.com*.okta-emea.com*.okta-gov.comWith automatic certificate challenge handling: MSI installation msiexec /i OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.x.x-xxxxxxx INSTALLDIR="c:\Program Files\Okta\DeviceTrust" EXEOPTIONS="/q2 OktaURL=https://&lt;your Okta org&gt;"EXE installation OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.0.0-XXXX.exe /q2 OktaURL=https://&lt;your-okta-org-url&gt;.comWithout automatic certificate challenge handling: MSI installation msiexec /i OktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.x.x-xxxxxxx INSTALLDIR="c:\Program Files\Okta\DeviceTrust" EXEOPTIONS="/q2 OktaURL=https://&lt;your Okta org&gt;/ SkipBrowserSetup=true"EXE installationOktaDeviceRegistrationTaskSetup-1.0.0-XXXX.exe /q2 OktaURL=https://&lt;your-okta-org-url&gt;.com/ SkipBrowserSetup=trueMethod 2: Manually install the Registration TaskThis procedure is provided in case you want to install the Registration Task manually during the testing or Proof of Concept phase of your implementation.Copy the Registration Task to the domain-joined Windows computer.Run the command prompt as an Administrator. Click Start.In the search box, enter cmd, and then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.								Change directories to the location of the file. Issue the command appropriate for the file type, either *.msi or *.exe. For installation and proxy server details, see the previous section Distribute the Registration Task using a management tool (SCCM).2.3 Verify certificate enrollment before you configure the Trusted option in app sign-on policy rules
        Before you configure the Trusted option for apps in app sign-on policy rules, you must make sure that certificates are installed in the certificate store on the domain-joined computers you have targeted for this Device Trust solution. If certificates are not installed and the Trusted setting is enabled, users are denied access to the app and are redirected to a security message advising them to contact their administrator. (You can configure the message to include a Learn more link to more information. See Enable the global Device Trust setting for your org). To verify certificate enrollment, Okta recommends that you use your management tool to parse the Windows Event Viewer, or use a command line to query the user certificate store directly. Look for Okta MTLS certificate.If an end user is deactivated, all Device Trust certificates installed on their domain-joined Windows computer(s) are revoked (but not removed) automatically. To remove revoked certificates, see Revoke and remove Device Trust certificates.Though you will probably use a management tool to verify that certificates are installed on multiple domain-joined computers, here are two ways to check enrollment on a single computer:Verify with Windows Event ViewerGo to Start and enter event in the search field.When Event Viewer appears at the top of the Start menu, press Enter to open it.Expand Applications and Services Logs.Click Okta Device Trust and find Event ID 1000. Verify with Microsoft Management Console
								Go to Start and enter mmc in the search field to open the console.Go to File and click Add/Remove Snap-in.Select Certificates and then click Add.In the Certificates snap-in dialog box, select My user account.Click Finish.Click OK.Under Console Root, expand Certificates - Current User.Expand the Personal folder, click Certificates and see the Okta MTLS certificate. 2.4. Optional. Use GPO to configure browsers to select the certificate automaticallyIf appropriate for your environment, you can use a Group Policy Object (GPO) tool instead of the default capability of the Device Registration Task to configure browsers to automatically select the Device Trust certificate. If you use a GPO tool, make sure that you have added the flag SkipBrowserSetup=true to the Registration Task installation command. See Install a Device Trust-supported version of the Okta IWA web app in your AD domain. If you don't configure automatic certificate selection — either through the Registration Task or a GPO — end users are prompted to select the certificate when accessing the app. To make the selection easier for end users, only the Okta Device Trust certificate will be shown to them  in this case.Depending on the refresh interval, changes you make using GPO may not be seen immediately on Windows client computers. For more information, see the Microsoft article Group Policy refresh interval for computers.To configure Chrome to select the Device Trust certificate automaticallyDownload policy templates.Extract the zip file to the Desktop of the Active Directory Domain Controller.Copy files to folders: Copy:C:\end users\Administrator\Desktop\policy_templates\windows\admx\en-US\chrome.admlTo:C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US\Copy:C:\end users\Administrator\Desktop\policy_templates\windows\admx\chrome.admxTo:C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\Open the Group Policy Management Console (GMPC).In the Start menu type Run.In Run, enter gpmc.msc.Expand to the appropriate domain, navigate to Group Policy Objects, right-click Default Domain Policy, and then click Edit.

												Step 3. Configure app sign-on policy rules in Okta About app sign-on policy rulesBy default, all Client options in the App Sign On Rule dialog box are pre-selected. To configure more granular access to the app, create rules  that reflect:Who users are, or the groups to which they belongWhether they are on or off network, or within a defined network zoneThe type of client running on their device  (Office 365 apps only)The platform of their mobile or desktop deviceWhether or not their devices are TrustedTaking an allow-list approach to sign-on policy rulesCreate one or more Allow rules to support the scenarios that will allow access to the app, then assign those rules the highest priority. Create a Deny catch-all rule that will apply to users who don't match the permissive scenarios you created in Step 1. Assign the Deny catch-all rule the lowest priority, just above the default rule. In the allow-list approach described here, the default rule is never reached because it is effectively negated by the Deny catch-all rule.For important security information about creating app sign-on policy rules, see About app sign-on policies.ProcedureIn the Admin Console, go to Applications &gt; Applications, and then click the SAML or WS-enabled app that you want to protect with Device Trust.Click the Sign On tab.Scroll down to the Sign On Policy, and click Add Rule.Configure one or more rules using the following example as a guide.This example shows Device Trust rules for managing access to Office 365. For other apps, note that the section If the user's client is any of these isn't present.Example AllowlistExample Rule 1: Exchange ActiveSync or Legacy Auth; All platforms; Any Trust; Allow accessEnter a descriptive rule name.ConditionsUnder PEOPLE, specify whether to apply the rule to individuals only or to individuals and groups.

Note that in this allowlist example, the Default rule is never reached because it is effectively negated by Rule 4.Revoke and remove Device Trust certificatesYou may need to revoke an end user's Device Trust certificate(s) from the Okta Certificate Authority. This is recommended if the computer is lost or stolen, or if the end user is deactivated. To re-secure an end user's computer with Device Trust after revoking their Device Trust certificate(s), you need to remove the revoked certificate from their computer before enrolling a new certificate.Be aware of the following:Steps 1 - 4 of this procedure revoke all Device Trust certificates from the Okta Certificate Authority that were issued to the end user. Certificate revocation does not remove existing certificates from managed Windows computers. In order to re-secure a Windows computer with Device Trust after revoking certificates, you must first remove any existing Device Trust certificate from the computer and then re-enroll the computer with a new certificate as detailed in Step 5. The Device Registration Task will not enroll a new certificate if another certificate (whether revoked or not) is present on the computer.Deactivating an end user in Okta also revokes their Device Trust certificate from the Okta Certificate Authority (but does not remove the certificate from their computer).In the Admin Console, go to Directory &gt; People.Click the end user whose Device Trust certificate you want to revoke.In the More Actions menu, click Revoke Trust Certificate.
					Read the message that displays, and then click Revoke Trust Certificate.Optional. If you want to re-secure the end user's computer with Device Trust, first remove any existing Device Trust certificate from the computer.To remove a certificate from a single computer (such as during testing or the Proof of Concept phase of your implementation), use a third-party management tool such as Certificate Manager Tool (Certmgr.exe) to remove the certificate issued by the Okta MTLS Certificate Authority.To remove certificates from multiple computers, use a third-party management tool such as GPO or SCCM to remove the certificate issued by the Okta MTLS Certificate Authority.TroubleshootingOkta Device Trust for Windows generates a certificate on domain-joined Windows devices and presents it to Okta when a Device Trust-secured WS-Fed or SAML app is launched. The two problems that you are most likely to encounter are:Trusted devices are unable to access Device Trust-secured apps.Untrusted devices are able to access Device Trust-secured apps.If you encounter either problem, try to correct it by performing Basic Troubleshooting. If the problem persists, perform Advanced Troubleshooting.Basic TroubleshootingTo perform basic troubleshooting, review the following areas:IWA web app installation and setupVerify the following:You have installed a Device Trust-capable version of the IWA web app in your Active Directory domain.If you use HTTPS for IWA, you have modified the IWA web.config file to support HTTPS binding.If the problem persists, proceed to Advanced Troubleshooting.EnablementVerify that you have enabled the global Device Trust setting in Security &gt; Device Trust.Registration taskVerify that you have distributed the Device Registration Task to Windows domain-joined workstations.Proxy server environments: For the Registration Task installation to succeed in environments that implement a proxy server, you must install Device Registration Task version 1.2.1 or later using a command line and append the appropriate HttpProxy parameter to the installation command. See Install the Registration Task. CertificateVerify that the certificate is installedOpen Microsoft Management Console. See Verify with Microsoft Management Console.Open the end user's personal store (not the Local computer store).Verify that a single certificate appears under Personal &gt; Certificates issued by MTLS Certificate Authority.If no certificate appears, see Advanced Troubleshooting.Known Issue – Auth failure caused by blocked Mutual TLS certificate exchangeThe Mutual TLS certificate exchange (handshake) in this Device Trust flow occurs on Okta URLs that are separate from your Okta org URL (indicated by the wildcard character (*) in the following example). Make sure to configure  proxy servers/proxy clients, as well as any endpoint protection software you may implement, in a way that does not block your clients from completing the certificate exchange with Okta. For example, if your organization uses an allowlist to limit outbound traffic, add these exact URLs to the allowlist, including the wildcard character (*):*.okta.com*.okta-emea.com*.okta-gov.comSign-on policyVerify the following:You have configured a sign-on policy that:Is applied to the WS-Fed or SAML app that you want to secure with Device Trust.Is applied to the correct user(s) and/or groups.Includes, at minimum, an Active rule that denies access to untrusted devices.System LogReview the System Log to verify the following Device Trust System Log events:

In order for automatic renewal to succeed, end users must be logged on to the domain-joined computer and connected to your corporate network.You can manually force certificate renewal to try to fix the following problems (requires Device Registration Task 1.3.1 or later):An end user's certificate was incorrectly or accidentally revoked by the admin through the Admin Console (see Revoke). The certificate was corrupted on the client due to accidental deletion, file corruption, or loss of the  private key.Open a command prompt and issue the following command:"C:\Program Files\Okta\DeviceTrust\OktaDeviceReg.exe" --user --forceRenewalRun the task in debug mode as the logged-on userMake sure the IWA server is reachable when the task is run (either directly over the internet or through a VPN).Open a command prompt and issue the following command:If the Device Trustcertificate isn't generated on the device, the task executes the following actions:

You may be asked to copy the token and provide it to Okta Support for analysis.Known issuesMultiple apps opening simultaneously: If multiple apps secured by Device Trust are configured to open automatically when end users sign in to their Okta dashboard from IE or Edge browsers, only one of the apps completes the Device Trust flow. Access to the remaining apps fails and end users are presented a message advising them to contact their administrator. (See Enable the global Device Trust setting for your org.)Okta Device Trust for Windows + certificate-based IWA for SSO: Configuring this Device Trust solution may cause an incompatibility issue if your org is configured with certificate-based IWA to support SSO for iOS and Android mobile devices. In that case, end users signing in to Okta using IWA from Windows computers with a Device Trust certificate and an IWA certificate installed may be presented with a certificate picker containing both certificates during the Desktop SSO flow, which may cause confusion. If end users select the Device Trust certificate, they will get a 403 error during the IWA flow.
					It may be possible to  enable certificate hinting in IIS so that only one certificate is shown to users.	See the Microsoft article Schannel SSP Technical Overview.		Checking .NET version: The Device Registration Task checks the version of the .NET Framework running on managed Windows computers. If the version isn't 4.5.2 or later, the Registration Task automatically installs version 4.5.2.
