                                            <p>Users must authenticate in order to access network-based services including email, file servers, and business applications. Using <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">groups<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Groups allow you to organize your end users and the apps they can access. Assigning apps to large sets of end users is made easier with groups.</span></a> can help you manage user access on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                                            <p>To help make assigning access to networks and applications easier, you can group users based on common themes. For example, you might create a group called <i>Sales</i> and grant it access to the <i>Sales Documentation</i> folder on a company file server.  Or, you might create a group called <i>Company Employees</i> that you assign to the company HR system. </p>
                                            <p>Groups are important tools for identity management systems, and group data typically resides in a directory. Most applications support groups, either at the application level, or within the application to specific resources. </p>
                                            <p>Groups are used in almost every IT department. This document clarifies how groups work in Okta.</p>

                                                    <p>Before you connect Okta to anything, you can create groups in your Okta organization.

                                                    <p>To manage your Okta groups, sign into your <strong>Administrator Dashboard</strong> and select <strong>Directory</strong> &gt; <strong>Groups</strong>.</p>
                                                    <h3>Active Directory Groups</h3>
                                                    <p>The most common source of groups is Active Directory. Nearly every business of significant size uses Active Directory in some form. Okta integrates Active Directory through an AD <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">agent<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>A software agent is a lightweight program that runs as a service outside of Okta. It is typically installed behind a firewall and allows Okta to tunnel communication between an on-premises service and Okta's cloud service. Okta employs several agent types: Active Directory, LDAP, RADIUS, RSA, Active Directory Password Sync, and IWA. For example, users can install multiple Active Directory agents to ensure that the integration is robust and highly available across geographic locations.</span></a>. </p>
                                                    <p><b>Note</b>: Okta does not support <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">Domain<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>A domain is an attribute of an Okta organization. Okta uses a fully-qualified domain name, meaning it always includes the top-level domain (.com, .eu, etc.), but does not include the protocol (https).</span></a> Local Groups containing members from multiple domains. We <i>do</i> support Universal Security Groups with cross-domain membership, provided that there is a two-way trust established between the domains.

                                                    <p>The AD agent imports groups differently depending on how your org is configured. After you install your first AD agent, you can specify the OUs that you want to connect Okta, and then run either an incremental or full import.</p>

                                                    <h3 class="p5">About Nested Groups</h3>
                                                    <p>Many directory systems and applications support the concept of nested groups (or groups in groups). Okta does not currently support nested groups. Okta imports all nested directories for group members and adds the user to each group in Okta. See the example below in which the group in AD on the left has two groups as child members, and the resultant group in Okta on the right.</p>

                                                    <p>In Active Directory, a universal security group (USG) allows for membership across all trusted forests in an AD environment. By default, USGs only exist in Okta if there is an AD agent in a domain importing users and groups. Enabling the <span class="s1"><b>Universal Security Group</b> (USG) option ignores domain boundaries when importing group memberships for your users. This assumes that the relevant domains are connected in Okta</span>.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        <img alt="User-added image" src="../../Resources/Images/Groups_1b_500x58.png" style="width: 500;height: 58;" />
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>You must also deploy an AD agent for every domain in your forest that contains the USG object that you want to sync with Okta. Each connected domain then imports its groups. When a user's group memberships match any groups that were imported (from any connected domain in the forest), Okta syncs the memberships for the user to each group. This option provides greater control of group imports from on-premises apps to Okta. Only groups from connected domains are imported.</p>
                                                    <p>For details about USG import scenarios, see <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/FAQ-Okta-and-AD-Groups" target="_blank">FAQ: Okta and AD Groups</a>​​.</p>
                                                    <h3>Importing Groups from Applications with Provisioning</h3>
                                                    <p>You can import groups from applications that have provisioning enabled. If you set up an import schedule for the app, it also imports new groups that you add and makes membership changes to existing ones. If you only want to import groups, set up provisioning but do not configure any user options. You cannot edit the memberships of these imported groups. </p>
                                                    <h3>Confirming Your Group Imports</h3>
                                                    <p>After you configure provisioning on an app that supports groups, Okta automatically imports groups from that app. Sign into your <strong>Administrator Dashboard</strong> and select <strong>Directory </strong>&gt;<strong> Groups</strong> to see newly imported groups. You can also select <strong>Reports</strong> &gt; <strong>System Log</strong>, and then select the <strong>Application Imports (Summary)</strong> report to see new groups that have been imported.</p>
                                                    <p>Following a successful import, under specific conditions Okta automatically sends an email to designated administrators. The email details the number of users and groups scanned, added, updated, or removed during the import. Okta only sends the email if the scan detects any new users or groups, or changes to any existing user profile or group membership.</p>

                                                    <p>If your application also imports groups from Active Directory (for example, Office 365 via DirSync), you might have duplicate groups in Okta if you have enabled provisioning on the app. This happens under the following conditions:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">You have two or more Active Directory forests. For example, forestA and forestZ.</li>
                                                        <li value="2">Microsoft DirSync is configured on forestA to synchronize all groups from the forest into an Office 365 (Azure AD) instance.</li>
                                                        <li value="3">Your Okta AD agent is configured to import users and groups from both forestA and forestZ into an Okta org.</li>
                                                        <li value="4">Okta is configured for provisioning with users from forestZ to the same Office 365 tenant.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                    <p>When you configure provisioning on the forestZ Office 365 app, it automatically imports groups from Office 365 into Okta. There are groups in Office 365 that are imported from forestA that already exist in Okta because of a sync from the forestA AD agent. The image below shows a mix of groups from Box, LDAP, and Active Directory alongside native groups in Okta.</p>

You can assign users to an application manually, person by person (see <a href="Directory_People.htm">People</a> for more details), but this does not scale well when you have a large number of users. You can create groups directly in Okta but then you must also manage those groups in Okta. Most admins already have groups in their corporate directories (for example, in Active Directory or an LDAP server) that have existing group management processes to keep them up to date.</p>
                                                    <p>It makes sense to use these groups for application assignment purposes.</p>

You can use groups imported from apps like Box and JIRA to manage application access, but this is not common. Groups from directories are more likely to be used for the management of group memberships. <br /><br /><b>Note</b>: You can convert application access and user properties settings so that individually-owned applications become group managed.

                                                    <p>When you assign a group to an application, there might be information in the target application that you want to assign to the user. For example, in Salesforce there is <strong>Profile</strong> and <strong>Role</strong> data.

                                                    <p>Okta enables you to define group membership in one directory and then use your groups in multiple connected systems. In on-premises systems, applications can connect to and query for groups from a central directory. Cloud apps often lack a common Active Directory, so you must use a different approach to use groups with multiple applications. Okta uses a feature called push groups to make this happen.</p>
                                                    <h3>About Group Push</h3>

The SAML standard addresses issues unique to the single sign-on (SSO) solution, and defines three roles: the end user, the IDP, and the SP.</span></a> sign-on process. This works well when you want to do the following:</p>
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li value="1">Add users to preexisting groups.</li>

Group information is sent in the SAML assertion when the user signs into a target app. This is less flexible than group push, in which you must use regular expressions to filter the groups you want. The advantage of this method is that it is available as part of the SAML template. If your target application accepts group information by SAML, you can configure a template without requiring an engineering effort to implement group push.

                                                    <p>Some services have additional data that you can assign to a newly created user. For example, when you assign a group to a Salesforce application with provisioning enabled, you can choose the Salesforce roles and profiles that are assigned to users in the group.</p>

So if you want to evaluate attributes from WD, AD, or other sources, map them to the Okta user profile attributes first.

				After completion, the rules you've created appear under the <b>Rules</b> tab.

				<p><img src="../../Resources/Images/group_membership_7.jpg" /></p><p>To edit your existing rules, click the <b>Edit</b> button—keeping in mind that a rule can only be edited when its status is <b>Inactive</b>.</p><p><img alt="User-added image" src="../../Resources/Images/group_membership_8.jpg" /></p>
				In an inactive rule, click the <b>Edit</b> button to change the conditions of the rule or, add or remove members from the excluded users list. Here is where you can also remove users from the <b>Exclude users</b> list, as needed.

To remove or change a previously assigned group, you must delete the rule and create a new one. To delete an inactive rule, click the <b>X</b>.</p><h3>Adding People Manually</h3>
				It is still possible to manually add or remove users to a rule-managed group, even if rules for that group already exist. Users added this way are displayed as such in the <b>Managed</b> column.<br /><p>If a user is manually added to a group then, through profile changes, begins to meet the condition, they will automatically become managed by the rule. When you add a rule-managed user of the group into the <b>Exclude users </b>field, they are automatically excluded from the rule.</p><h3><a id="#ConditionsEE" name="ConditionsEE"></a>Conditions of the Expression Editor</h3><h4>Constraints</h4><ul><li value="1">Expressions must have a valid syntax and use logical operators, leveraging the <a href="http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/okta_expression_lang.html" target="_blank">Okta Expression Language</a>.</li><li value="2">Expressions must evaluate to Boolean.</li><li value="3">Expressions cannot contain an assignment ("=") operator.</li><li value="4">User attributes used in expressions can only refer to available Okta user attributes.</li></ul><h4>Supported Functions</h4><ul><li value="1">Most functions are supported in <a href="http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/okta_expression_lang.html" target="_blank">Okta Expression Language</a>. <br /><b>Note</b>:&#160;In the context of custom Expression for Group Rules, only <i>group</i> and <i>user</i> attributes are supported.
