        <h3>Adding People</h3>
        <p>Adding people to your organization allows them to have their own <strong>My Applications</strong> page. Do the following to add end users to your org.</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>From the <strong>People</strong> page, click <strong>Add</strong> <b>Person</b>.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Add Person</strong> page is displayed.</p>

                <p>Enter the <strong>Username</strong>.</p>
                <p>The username must be in email address format, and is typically the user's primary email address. Users sign in using this username.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Enter a <strong>Primary email</strong> address.</p>
                <p>This can be any valid email address that the user has access to. Typically this is the same address used for the user's login name.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Optionally, enter a <strong>Secondary email</strong>.</p>
                <p>This email can be used as a back up in case the user can't access their primary email. This is not required.</p>

                <p>Click<strong> Add Person</strong>, or add another by clicking <strong>Save and Add Another</strong>.</p>

            <li value="7">If you click the <strong>Send user activation email now</strong> check box, your end user immediately receives their <strong>Welcome to Okta!</strong> activation email. Otherwise, these users are at <strong>Pending Activation</strong> status, and are <strong>not</strong> notified via email of their Okta account.</li>

        <h3 class="entry-title" style="">Activating People</h3>
        <p>Activating people in your organization changes their account status from <strong>Pending</strong> to <strong>Active</strong>. Active end users receive an email that steps them through the process of setting up their unique account within your org.</p>
        <p>From the <strong>Okta People,</strong> page you can view the status of each of your end users from the <strong>Status</strong> column (the far left column on the page).  Their status may be <strong>Pending Activation</strong>,<strong> Active</strong>,<strong> Password reset</strong>, or<strong> Deactivated</strong>.</p>
        <p>There are two ways to activate end users, depending on when their accounts were created:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">If the user already appears under your <strong>Person &amp; Username</strong> list and they are pending activation, you can activate them simply by clicking the <strong>Activate</strong> link, found in the <strong>Status</strong> column directly across from their name.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To activate one or more people who have been recently added, do the following:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From the <b>More Actions</b> menu, click <strong>Activate</strong>. The <strong>Activate People</strong> page appears.</li>
            <li value="2">From the list of users, select the users you want to activate and click <strong>Activate Selected</strong>. Or, click <strong>Activate All</strong> to activate everyone that appears on the list.</li>
            <li value="3">An<strong> Activate People</strong> page appears. Click <b>Activate</b> to activate the chosen end users, or click <strong>Cancel</strong> to abort. When activated, each user appears as <b>Active</b> in the <strong>Status</strong> column.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>An email is sent to each user's primary or secondary email address, informing them that their accounts are active. Once active, they can access all the provisioned applications assigned to them.</p>
        <p>If you reactivate a person who was previously deactivated, the user is re-imported, but their apps remain unassigned.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Just In Time</strong> provisioning feature (JIT) enables automatic user account creation in Okta the first time a user authenticates.</p>

                <p>Just In Time (JIT) provisioning enables automatic user account creation in Okta the first time a user authenticates with one of the following methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Active Directory (AD) Delegated Authentication</li>
                    <li value="2">Desktop Single Sign On</li>
                    <li value="3">Inbound SAML</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Requirements</b>
                </p>
                <p>JIT only works for users who are not already Okta users. This means that users confirmed on the import results page, regardless of whether or not they were subsequently activated, are not eligible for JIT activation. When JIT is enabled, users do not receive activation emails.</p>
                <p>If you are using JIT provisioning with AD users, they must be imported first. After you enable JIT, import user accounts from AD. The import process defines the set of AD accounts that can be used to create Okta accounts (whether via JIT or the confirmation process). AD accounts that are not on the import list cannot be used to create Okta accounts.</p>
                <p><b>Enabling JIT</b>
                </p>
                <p>Perform the following steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li value="1">From your Administrator Dashboard, select <b>Security &gt; Authentication</b> and select the <b>JIT Provisioning</b> tab.</li>
                    <li value="2">Click the <b>Edit</b> button and select the <b>Enable Just In Time Provisioning</b> check box.</li>
                    <li value="3">Click the <b>Save</b> button.</li>
