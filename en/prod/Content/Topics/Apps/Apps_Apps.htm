        <h1>Applications</h1>
        <p>The Okta Application Network is a catalog of thousands of pre-integrated applications that make it easy to manage authentication and provisioning for all of your users. We offer the industry’s broadest and deepest set of integrations, and we constantly monitor the network, maintaining connections and adding new ones by the day.</p>
        <p>Okta enables you to provide SSO access to cloud, on-premise, and mobile applications. You sign into Okta and you can then launch any of your web apps without having to reenter your credentials. Okta establishes a secure connection with a user's browser and then authenticates the user to Okta-managed apps using one of two SSO integration methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Okta’s Secure Web Authentication (SWA)</li>
            <li value="2">Federated (supporting SAML or another proprietary federated authentication protocol)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Okta provides access to cloud apps with the Okta Application Network (OAN), a collection of thousands of supported applications. SSO protocols and provisioning APIs are maintained by Okta. The applications in the OAN can use SWA, SAML or OpenID, or proprietary APIs.</p>
        <p>Okta also provides integrations for on-premise web-based applications. You can integrate on-premise apps using SWA for SSO, SAML toolkits, and support for provisioning and de-provisioning into applications that expose provisioning APIs publicly.</p>
        <p>Okta provides integrations for mobile apps whether they are HTML5 web apps optimized for mobile platforms, Native iOS, or Android apps. You can access any web application in the OAN with SSO from any mobile device. Mobile web apps can use industry-standard SAML or Okta’s SWA SSO technology. Native applications like Box Mobile can be integrated using SAML authentication for registration and OAuth for ongoing usage.</p>

            <div class="MCDropDownBody" id="MCDropDownBody_2302339488_0" style="display: none;">
                <p>SWA was created for apps that do not support federated SSO. When you enable SWA for an app, end users see a link below their app icon on their My Applications page. Selecting the link enables them to set up and update their credentials for that app. Okta stores the end user's credentials in an encrypted format using strong AES encryption combined with a customer-specific private key. When end users click an application icon, Okta securely posts their credentials to the app login page over SSL and the user is automatically signed in.</p>
                <p>By configuring users' sign-in options, you can make their SWA credentials match their Okta credentials so additional sign-ins are not required after you have signed into Okta.</p>
                <p>When you configure your sign-in options, you can set up SWA so that</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">User sets username and password</li>
                    <li value="2">Administrator sets username and password</li>
                    <li value="3">Administrator sets username, user sets password</li>
                    <li value="4">Administrator sets username, password is the same as user's Okta password</li>
                    <li value="5">Users share a single username and password set by administrator</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Note:</b> The SWA sign-in options are not configurable when Push Okta password is configured as a provisioning option.</p>
                <h4>Administrator Sets Username and Password</h4>
                <p>This second option on the Sign On tab is one that provides the most robust level of admin control. It allows the admin to set all usernames and passwords for an app instance, after which the credentials are never exposed to their Okta end-users. This option provides a way to shut off user access to the credentials of sensitive apps. For this to work, ensure that the user does not have an alternative way to reset their app's password. It is also useful for cases where admins must supply a new, obfuscated password to an Okta user—no active communication with the user is required.</p>
                <p>To set the usernames and passwords for a particular SWA app, do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li value="1">Outside of Okta, access the downstream app you wish to assign.</li>
                    <li value="2">Establish the username and password within the app.</li>
                    <li value="3">Return to Okta and access or create the app in the OAN.</li>
                    <li value="4">Choose the Sign On tab (or step) on the app page.</li>
                    <li value="5">Choose Administrator sets username and password and click the Next button.</li>
                    <li value="6">Assign the app to users and assign their usernames and passwords.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Note:</b> The admin-created password can only be viewed when initially created. After sending, the password is no longer visible to the admin. To change the password, it must be reset in the downstream app, then reset in Okta.</p>
                <p>If the chosen app was previously assigned to an established Okta group, please note that group members do require the individual, manual updates of usernames and passwords for each user.</p>
                <p>The <b>Reveal Password</b> feature is disabled for this option, as end-users will never have access to their passwords.</p>

                <p>Okta provides integration toolkits to enable apps that are not in the OAN to support SAML. You can obtain SAML integration toolkits for .NET, Java, and PHP platforms.</p>
                <h4>SSO for Active Directory-Authenticated Web Apps</h4>
                <p>You can integrate on-premise web apps with Okta. On-premises web apps that use Active Directory (AD) credentials for authentication do not use Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), but instead require users to enter their AD credentials when they sign in on a browser. When you configure Okta to delegate authentication to AD, signing in to internal web apps can also be automated.</p>
                <p>Here's how Okta enables SSO for AD-authenticated internal web applications:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li value="1">Configure Okta to delegate authentication to AD.</li>
                    <li value="2">Customer has on-premises apps authenticating to AD.</li>
                    <li value="3">Users sign into Okta with AD credentials.</li>
                    <li value="4">Users access their internal web apps with SWA using AD credentials.</li>
                    <li value="5">The internal web apps authenticate users against AD.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Okta uses SWA to automatically sign users into internal web apps. When you configure an internal web application to delegate authentication to AD (the same source to which Okta delegates authentication), Okta captures the user’s AD password during the sign-in process and automatically sets that password for that user in any applications that also delegate to AD. This enables users to click a link to access these apps, and then sign in automatically. Okta synchronizes the AD password securely. If the password is later changed in AD, this event is captured during sign-in to Okta and immediately updated in the secure password store for that app, ensuring that the next sign-in attempt is successful.</p>

                <p>There are two common SWA template apps that you can use to create apps on demand—one that does a POST to a sign-in page (the Template App) and one that uses a plugin to POST (the Template Plugin App). These template apps allow you to create application integrations in real-time on a running system.</p>

                <p>Okta Mobile uses SSO to extend its functionality to apps on your iPad or iPhone. The Okta Mobile application provides an embedded Okta browser and app menu. You can download and install the Okta Mobile app from the Apple App store. </p>
                <h4>Enabling Mobile Access to Applications</h4>
                <p>With OMM you can publish applications to an App Store accessible from within Okta Mobile. This provides your end users a single place to go to download their mobile applications. The mobile apps available are based directly on the apps assigned to each user within Okta, you simply have to enable the desired apps for that application integration.</p>
                <p>Apps installed via Okta Mobile are subject to the Managed Open-In policies as described above. This ensures that data is only shared between the applications you have configured and assigned to your users. </p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> The <strong>Mobile Access</strong> section is only available for those applications in the Okta Application Network where native apps have been tested to work with OMM policies.</p>
                <p>To activate a native app:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li value="1">Navigate to <strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
                    <li value="2">Search for, then select, a configured app that supports mobile access, then select the <strong>Mobile</strong> tab.</li>
                    <li value="3">Select <b>Activate</b> from the drop down menu to activate the operating system(s) for which you want to enable Okta Mobility Management (OMM) for this app.
					</li>
                </ol>
                <p>To configure other native app settings, click the pencil icon and select any of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Allow end users to install the app from the company app store. (Android and iOS).</li>
                    <li value="2">Prompt end users who have already installed an iOS mobile app on their own to allow their admin to manage the app. (iOS only)</li>
                    <li value="3">Prompt users to install the app on enrollment. (iOS only)</li>

                        <p>You can optionally configure Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) to synchronize your users' mobile devices with your Exchange server. EAS is a protocol that enables your mobile devices to connect to your Exchange server. This pushes end users' email, calendar, and contacts directly to their device(s).</p>
                        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Google's implementation of Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) is not available for free Google Apps accounts. It is available for paying Google Apps for Business, Education and Government customers.</p>
                        <p>If you use Office 365 or Google Apps, this is an important configuration procedure you must complete for each app that connects with your Exchange server.</p>
                        <p>To configure EAS:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li value="1">Scroll to the <strong>Exchange Active Synch Settings</strong> section of the app's <strong>Mobile</strong> tab.</li>
                            <li value="2">Select <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
                            <li value="3">Check the <strong>Enable Exchange Active Synch</strong> box.
						<ul><li value="1">For Office 365 or Google Apps:
								<p>Office 365 / Android: You need to deploy the <b>Divide Productivity</b> app (available by default) to enable mail configuration within <b>Android for Work</b>.</p><p>Google Apps / Android: You need to deploy the <b>Gmail</b> app (available by default) to enable mail configuration within <b>Android for Work</b>.</p><p>The exchange servers for these are hosted in the cloud and the <strong>Host URL</strong> field is automatically populated and cannot be edited.</p><p><b>Profile Name</b>: You can optionally specify a profile name. This is the name that is displayed on your end user's device. Note that if you subsequently modify this field, email will be resynchronized across all devices.</p></li><li value="2">For On-Premises Exchange servers:
								<p>Android: You need to deploy the <b>Divide Productivity</b> app (available by default) to enable mail configuration within <b>Android for Work</b>.</p><p>You need to have already added a Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) app to your org.</p><p>
									Specify the <strong>Host URL</strong> of the on-prem exchange server:<br /></p></li></ul></li>
                            <li value="4">Click <strong>Save</strong> to commit the change.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Known Limitation</h4>
                        <p>If you have configured EAS, even changed passwords will be pushed to your users' devices, eliminating the need for them to enter passwords.</p>
                        <p>However, if you have AD Del Auth enabled, in order for the device to update with a new password, your end users must do one of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li value="1">Change the password in Okta, which in turn will push that password to Windows.</li>
                            <li value="2">Enable <strong>Synch Okta Password</strong> for the app in question (see Provisioning and Deprovisioning Overview).  Then the user resets their password in Windows and the next time the user logs into Okta, the password is updated and pushed to the user's device.</li>
