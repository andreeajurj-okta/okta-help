                                            <h4>SSO for Active Directory-Authenticated Web Apps</h4>
                                            <p>You can integrate on-premise web apps with Okta. On-premises web apps that use Active Directory (AD) credentials for authentication do not use Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), but instead require users to enter their AD credentials when they sign in on a browser. When you configure Okta to delegate authentication to AD, signing in to internal web apps can also be automated.</p>
                                            <p>Here's how Okta enables SSO for AD-authenticated internal web applications:</p>

                                                <li value="1">Configure Okta to delegate authentication to AD.</li>
                                                <li value="2">Customer has on-premises apps authenticating to AD.</li>

                                                <li value="4">Users access their internal web apps with SWA using AD credentials.</li>
                                                <li value="5">The internal web apps authenticate users against AD.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>Okta uses SWA to automatically sign users into internal web apps. When you configure an internal web application to delegate authentication to AD (the same source to which Okta delegates authentication), Okta captures the user’s AD password during the sign-in process and automatically sets that password for that user in any applications that also delegate to AD. This enables users to click a link to access these apps, and then sign in automatically. Okta synchronizes the AD password securely. If the password is later changed in AD, this event is captured during sign-in to Okta and immediately updated in the secure password store for that app, ensuring that the next sign-in attempt is successful.</p>
