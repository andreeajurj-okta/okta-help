Using their USB connector, end-users simply press on the YubiKey hard token to emit a new, one-time password (OTP) to securely log into their accounts. Security is assured, as all YubiKey validation occurs within the Okta Cloud. As such, Okta guarantees Okta-level quality of service and uptime for YubiKey authentication.</p>

If an end-user reports their YubiKey as lost or stolen, you can remove these individual tokens using its unique serial number. This method is also the way to remove unassigned YubiKeys. Ensure the YubiKey has already been reset by following the <b>Resetting MFA</b> instructions. A YubiKey serial can not be removed if it is currently active for a user.</p>

An admin can also reprogram the YubiKey by following the steps within the Programming Yubikeys for Okta file, which can be found in Configuring Yubikey Tokens. This generates a new Configuration Secrets file for upload, and allows the token to be re-enrolled by any end user within the Okta framework.</p>

                                            <p>Okta's native Multifactor Authentication (MFA) method, <b>Okta Verify</b>, balances ease of use with security. However, sometimes circumstances dictate your choices. Feedback from hundreds of Okta customers currently using Okta for MFA, exposed a number of scenarios where a third-party MFA provider was needed. Some customers had a pre-existing investment in a legacy MFA provider and were wary of the cost and effort in changing their user experience. Others required the high-level assurance that hardware tokens can deliver for a subset of privileged users. Still others were in a state of transition—eager to adopt Okta Verify, but reluctant to migrate from their old provider too abruptly.</p>
                                            <p>While authentication methods do matter, they are only a part of the story with Okta. Our flexible policy framework, catalog of thousands of app integrations, and contextual access control allow our customers to broadly deploy MFA across their organizations. You are not restricted to Okta Verify—various third-party authentication methods are compatible and seamless with the Okta identity platform. Okta can even support multiple factors simultaneously, allowing organizations to migrate between factors or support heterogeneous user environments.</p>
                                            <p>This is why Okta expertly supports several third-party MFA providers. Click to view a table listing supported providers and details about their integration.</p>
