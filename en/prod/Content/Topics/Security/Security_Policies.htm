        <h1>Security Policies</h1>
        <p>Use the Policies page to configure sign on policies and, if you have them enabled, group password policies, mobile policies, and wifi policies. </p>
        <h2><a name="signOnPolicies"></a>Sign On Policies</h2>
        <p>Sign-on policies determine the types of authentication challenges a user receives. A policy can be based on a variety of factors, such as location, group definitions, and authentication type. A policy can specify actions to take, such as allowing access, prompting for a challenge, and setting the time before prompting for another challenge.</p>

                <p>You can specify the order in which policies are executed and add any number of policies. If a policy in the list does not apply to the user trying to sign in, the system moves to the next policy. </p>
                <p>You can specify any number of policies and the order in which they are executed.  There is one required policy named <em>Default</em>. By definition, the default policy applies to all users.</p>
                <p>In addition to the default policy, which you cannot delete, there is another policy named <em>Legacy</em> that is present only if you have already configured MFA. This policy reflects the MFA settings that were in place when you enabled your Sign-on policy, and ensures that no changes in MFA behavior occur unless you modify your policy. If needed, you can delete it.</p>
                <p>When a policy is evaluated, the conditions in the policy are combined with the conditions in the associated rules. Rules are applied when all these conditions are met. A policy with no rules cannot be applied.</p>
                <p>Policies can contain multiple rules. The order of the rules is important. </p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> Create a policy for all Human Resource employees that specifies that all employees are given an additional MFA challenge when signing in except the Director of Human Resources.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">This scenario requires one policy and two rules.</li>
                    <li value="2">The policy is applied to the HR group.</li>
                    <li value="3">Rule 1 could be titled "Exclude Director" and specify no actions.</li>
                    <li value="4">Rule 2 could be titled "Challenge Everyone Else" and specify the additional MFA challenge.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The order of the rules cannot be changed. After determining that the employee signing in is a member of the group HR. If so, the first rule is checked to see if the person is the director. If so, no action takes place and rule 2 is not evaluated. If not, rule 2 is evaluated. If the order of the rules were reversed, everyone would be challenged, and rule two would never be evaluated.</p>

                <h4>Creating a Sign-on Policy</h4>
                <p>To create a Sign-on Policy, click the <b>Add New Okta Sign-on Policy</b> button. In the screen that opens, enter any desired policy name and description. </p>
                <p>You can specify that a policy can only be applied to certain groups. To assign a policy to groups, enter the desired group names in the <b>Assign to Groups</b> field. The group names must already exist before assigning them to a policy. When done, click the <b>Create Policy</b> button.</p>
                <p>When a policy is evaluated, the conditions in the policy are combined with the conditions in the rule. The rule is applied when all these conditions are met. A policy with no rule cannot be applied.</p>
                <h4>Adding Rules</h4>
                <p>Click the Add Rule button to add a rule to a policy. Complete the following fields as needed.</p>

        <h2>Group Password Policies</h2>
        <p>Group password policies allow you to define password policies and associated rules to enforce password settings on the group and authentication-provider level. You can create multiple policies with more or less restrictive rules and apply them to different groups. These Okta password policies  only apply to Okta and Active Directory (AD)-mastered users. Password policy for LDAP-mastered users is managed within its own directory service.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Group Password Policies is an Early Access feature; contact Okta support to enable it.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Legacy Policy
			<p>A Legacy Policy is automatically created for Okta-mastered users. In previous versions of the platform, password policy settings were located on the Security &gt; General page. For orgs that were created before Group Password Policy was enabled, the Legacy policy and associated Legacy rules are preserved. Existing password policy settings for an org are copied to the Legacy Policy. All Legacy policy and rule settings are configurable.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Active Directory Policy
			<p>If you currently have one or more Active Directory (AD) integrations, an AD policy is automatically created for you. You can customize the elements of the policy and its rules.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Using Softlock
        <p>For AD-mastered users, Okta provides a Softlock feature, used in conjunction with AD to prevent end-user lockouts. Previously, repeatedly entering an invalid password during Okta login could lock an end-user out of their Windows account and hardware device. This option also prevents a malicious third party from using Okta to lock up an end user via the web.</p><p>To enable Softlock, ensure that the number entered for Lock out user after &lt;#&gt; unsuccessful attempts is less than that of the invalid password count in AD. For example, if your maximum number of failed Windows logins is 10, you might want to set your maximum for Okta failed logins to 5. If an end-user exceeds the Okta count, no further login attempts will be sent to Active Directory. The failed login attempts will not be incremented in AD, and the user cannot lock themselves out of their Windows account. If locked out of Okta, the end-user or an Okta Admin can unlock the Okta account.</p></li>

                <p>In general, password policies work the same as sign-on policies. Configure the following items.</p>
                <p><u>For new policies</u>
                </p>
                <p><b>Policy name:</b> Enter a unique name.</p>
                <p><b>Policy description:</b> Enter a description.</p>
                <p><b>Add group:</b> Enter the name of the group(s) to which this policy will apply.</p>
                <p><b>Authentication Providers:</b> An authentication provider is the primary source of user-specific data. Use the drop-down menu to specify the appropriate source. Note the following settings for each policy type:</p>
                <p><b>Default policy:</b> the authentication provider cannot be changed.</p>
                <p><b>Legacy policy:</b> the authentication provider should be set to Okta.</p>
                <p><b>Active Directory policy:</b> the authentication provider should be set to Active Directory. For more information about using AD as an authentication provider, see Installing and Configuring the Active Directory Agent.</p>
                <p><u>For all policies</u>
                </p>
                <p><b>Minimum length:</b> Specify a minimum password length of 4 to 30 characters (the default length is eight characters).</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> For AD-mastered users, these requirements are set and enforced by AD. Ensure that the settings here duplicate the minimum settings of AD.</p>
                <p><b>Complexity requirements:</b> Complex passwords increase the security of your users' accounts. Choose any or all of the options in the list to define the level of complexity that is required for your users' passwords.
        <ul><li value="1">For AD-mastered users, these requirements are set and enforced by AD. Ensure that the settings here duplicate the minimum settings of AD.</li><li value="2">For non AD-mastered users, if selecting <b>Does not contain part of username</b>, please note that passwords which include elements of your username may be rejected. These elements can include domain and domain extensions such as .com or .org.</li></ul></p>
                <p><b>Password age (Okta-mastered users only):</b> Configure settings related to password longevity. This setting does not define how long a password is valid for a session.</p>
                <p><b>Enforce password history for last . . .:</b> Specify the number of distinct passwords that a user must create before they can reuse a previous password. This prevents users from reusing a previous password for a specified period of time. You can configure this setting from 1â€“30 passwords.</p>
                <p><b>Minimum password age is. . .:</b> Specify the minimum time interval required between password changes. This setting prevents users from bypassing the enforce password history requirement. You can configure this setting for up to 9,999 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>Password expires after . . .:</b> Specify how long a password remains valid before it must be changed. When a user's password expires, they must change it in order to sign in to Okta. You can configure this setting for up to 999 days. Note that users will not receive an expiration warning if this field is set to fewer than six days.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Password expiration cannot be accurately calculated for users created before March 10, 2014. For these users, the expiration period starts with the user's last sign-in date instead of the time the user last changed their password.</p>
                <p><b>Prompt user. . .:</b> Specify the number of days prior to password expiration that users are prompted to change their password. Users can change their password when prompted, or wait until the expiration date. You can configure this setting for up to 999 days.</p>
                <p><b>Lock out:</b> Configure lockout settings.</p>
                <p><b>Lock out user after . . .:</b> Specify the number of times users can attempt to log in to their accounts with an invalid password before their accounts are locked. The maximum is 100 invalid log in attempts. For AD-mastered users, set the number above that of your AD lockout maximum to enable Softlock.</p>
                <p><b>Account is automatically unlocked after . . .:</b> Specify how long a locked account remains locked before it is unlocked automatically. Auto unlock requires no additional user action, and the minimum setting is one minute. You can configure this setting for up to 9,999 minutes. It is not enabled by default. Note: This feature is free for customers in the U.S. and Canada. Admins with international orgs should contact customer support before enabling SMS.</p>
                <p><b>Important:</b> To send users an SMS message as part of the self-service account unlock process, be sure to enable Allow SMS for self-service operations in the Account Recovery section in addition to selecting the self-service account unlock option in the rules editor.</p>
                <p><b>Show lockout failures:</b> When enabled, this setting informs end-users that they have locked their account due to failed logins. When disabled, the user only receives a Sign in failed! message for each attempt, even after the account is locked. This also triggers an admin notification that the user has been locked out.</p>
                <p><b>Unlock:</b> Choose whether end-users who have successfully unlocked their Okta accounts can also be automatically unlocked in AD.</p>
                <p><b>Unlock users in Okta and Active Directory:</b> Users who successfully unlock their accounts are automatically unlocked in AD as well.</p>
                <p><b>Unlock users in only Okta:</b> If users who successfully unlock their Okta accounts are locked in both AD and Okta, they will require admin assistance to unlock their AD account.</p>
                <h4>Configure Account Recovery settings</h4>
                <p><b>Reset/Unlock recovery emails are valid for:</b> Specify how long the recovery link remains valid before it expires. The maximum period is 9,999 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>Minimum security answer complexity is:</b> Specify the minimum number of characters that security answers must contain.</p>
                <p><b>Allow SMS for self-service operations:</b> Select if you want to allow end users who have forgotten their password to be able to reset passwords using SMS. If end users forget their passwords, Okta sends them a text message with a password reset code. The first time end users log on after this feature is enabled, they are given the option to either enter a phone number, or click Remind me later to receive a reminder in 30 days.</p>
                <p>Also, if the self-service unlock feature is enabled, users can SMS to unlock your account. </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><b>On Network:</b> Applies the rule to users whose IP address is listed in the Public Gateway IPs list.</p>
                    <p><b>Off Network:</b> Applies the rule to users whose IP address is not listed in the Public Gateway IPs list.</p>
                    <p><b>Anywhere:</b> Applies the rule to all users regardless of whether or not their IP address is listed in the Public Gateway IPs list.</p>
                    <p><b>Note:</b> For information on the Public Gateway IPs list and the IP Zones feature, see <a href="Security_Network.htm">Network</a>.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><b>The user can:</b> Specify whether users can change or reset their password, or unlock their account. Note the following:</p>
                <p><b>Change password:</b> Checkbox must be selected in order for perform self-service password reset to be available.</p>

                <p>In general, mobile policies work the same as sign-on policies. However, the following items are only present in mobile policies.</p>
                <p><b>Define your Passcode Policy:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>

                    <li value="5"><b>Maximum passcode age:</b> Number of days after which end users must change their passcodes (none, or a positive integer from 1 to 730, representing days).</li>
                    <li value="6"><b>Passcode history limit:</b> The number of previous unique passcodes that end users cannot reuse  (none, or a positive integer from 1 to 50).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Define your Managed Open-In Policy:</b>

                <ul>
                    <li value="1">Optional. Enter a brief, custom User Agreement in the text field.  This agreement then appears on your end users' devices and must be acknowledged prior to proceeding with enrollment in OMM.

                    <li value="2">Okta Mobility Management Access rules determine whether users are allowed to enroll their devices through Okta Mobile. All users have a Default Rule that is initially set to <b>deny </b>associated users the ability to enroll their devices.

        <h2>Wifi Policies</h2>
        <p>Admins can configure one or more Wifi policies that are automatically pushed to their end users who are enrolled in Okta Mobility Management (OMM).
