                                            <p>Policies are the first line of defense in keeping an organization secure. Okta policies allow control of various elements of security, including end-user passwords, the authentication challenges a user receives, the devices they can use, and the places they use them from. A policy can be based on a variety of factors, such as location, group definitions, and authentication type.</p>
                                            <h2><a name="Group"></a>Group Password Policies</h2>

                                            <p>Group password policies allow you to define password policies and associated rules to enforce password settings on the group and authentication-provider level. You can create multiple policies with more or less restrictive rules and apply them to different <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">groups<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Groups allow you to organize your end users and the apps they can access.

When we refer to "end users" we are generally referring to the people who the administrators serve. That is, those who use Okta chiclets to access their apps, but have no administrative control.</span></a>. For AD-mastered users, ensure that your Active Directory password policies don't conflict with the Okta policies. Passwords for AD-mastered users are still managed by the directory service. Some applications, such as Microsoft Office 365 and Google G&#160;Suite, check an Okta password policy when provisioning a user to ensure that the Okta policy meets the application's password requirements. </p>
                                            <p>It is sometimes possible for a user's Okta password to meet these requirements while the password policy itself does not, which results in an error during the provisioning attempt. If you observe provisioning errors after configuring or editing an Okta password policy, ensure that it meets the application's requirements, typically, eight characters with an upper and lower case character and either a symbol or number.</p>
                                            <p><b>Note:</b> The default password policy is applied when a user is created. Group assignment on password policy is not evaluated when user is created.</p>

						<ul><li value="1"><b>Minimum length</b> – Specify a minimum password length of four to 30 characters (the default value is eight).<p> <b>Note</b>: The maximum length for a password is 72 characters. You cannot change the maximum length.</p></li><li value="2"><b>Common password check</b> – Check <em>Restrict use of common passwords</em> to ensure that passwords are not too weak based on a list of the most commonly used passwords </li><li value="3"><b>Complexity requirements</b> – Complex passwords increase the security of your users' accounts. Choose any or all of the items in the list to define the level of complexity that is required for your users. </li><li value="4"><b>Password age</b> – Specifies how often users must change their passwords and prevents them from reusing the same passwords within a specified period of time. Setting the password age does not set how long a password is valid for a session.

								<ul><li value="1">Password history enforces the number of passwords that must be different before your users can reuse a password. You can specify from 1–24 passwords.</li><li value="2">Minimum password age enforces the minimum time interval required between password changes. This setting prevents users from bypassing the enforce password history requirement. You can configure this setting for 1–999 hours or days.</li><li value="3">The password expiration enforces how long a password remains valid before it must be changed. Users are warned five days before the expiration date that their passwords are going to expire. They can change their password when the warning appears or wait until the expiration date. After a password expires, users must change their passwords to sign into Okta. You can configure this setting for 1–999 days. Note that users do not receive an expiration warning if this field is set to less than six days.

					<p><b>Note:</b> Password expiration cannot be accurately calculated for users created before March 10, 2014. For these users, the expiration period starts with the user's last sign-in date instead of the time the user last changed their password.</p></li></ul><li value="3"><b>Lockout</b> — Select what happens when users enter an invalid password too many times. You can set the number of failed attempts before the account is locked to 1–100 attempts. You can allow locked-out users to reset the password themselves (i.e., <i>Forgot password?</i>). Select how a locked account is unlocked:</li><ul><li value="1"><b>Users can unlock their account with self service</b> — If you do not permit self service, see <a href="../Directory/Directory_People.htm#Unlockin">Unlocking an End User's Password</a> for how to reset users' passwords. Locked out users that wish to reset their password must unlock their account first before attempting to reset their password.</li><li value="2"><b>Account is automatically unlocked after __ minutes</b> — The account is automatically reset without additional action from users after the number of minutes that you specify. The minimum setting is one minute.


								<p><b>Important:</b> To allow users to receive SMS messages as part of the self-service unlock process, you must enable <b>Allow SMS</b> for self-service operations in the <b>Organization</b> section shown below, in addition to configuring  self-service unlock in this section.</p></li><li value="3"><a name="SendLockoutEmail"></a><b>Send lockout email to user</b> — Select to send locked-out users an email if their account is locked due to too many failed sign-in attempts.

                                                    <p>Okta amalgamates the conditions of a policy and the conditions of a rule to determine whether a policy is applied to a particular user. Policies generally consist of large elements that can be applied to many users, such as a minimum password length. Rules consist of conditions such as place and circumstance, like geographical location or whether the user is on or off a company network. A policy that contains no rules cannot be applied.

</p>
                                                    <p>For example, if you create a policy which you assign to the group “Admins”, you would create conditions special to the needs of administrators. The policy might contain a minimum password length of 12 to restrict password hacking. An applied rule to the policy might be one that allows for a self-service unlock only under certain conditions. One condition might be whether a particular admin is off or on your company network.</p>

                                                        <li value="1">

    A policy that contains no rules cannot be successfully applied—a warning will indicate that no rules exist for this policy.
</li>
                                                        <li value="2">    Ensure that any restrictive rules are placed at the top of the <b>Priority</b> list. In the example of the HR Director above, “Exclude Director of HR” must be placed before the rule that applies to everyone—the most restrictive rule must be placed first. </li>
                                                        <li value="3">If “Everyone” were on top, special conditions would not apply and a policy evaluation would be unnecessary.
    If multiple rules are present and the conditions of the first rule are not satisfied, Okta skips this rule and evaluates the following one.</li>

The default lifetime is 15 minutes, and the maximum period is 6 months. Setting a factor lifetime is a way for end users to sign out for the amount of time noted in the Factor Lifetime and not have to authenticate again with MFA at the next sign in. End users must check a box to confirm that the setting should be applied. An example is <em>Do not challenge me on this device for the next 15 minutes</em>. In the case, after signing out, there is no MFA prompt if the new sign in is within 15 minutes of the last sign in with MFA.   If users do not check the box, they are always prompted for MFA. The time since the last sign in is noted in the bottom of the Dashboard; however, end users must refresh the screen to see the updated value.</p>

This is idle time before users see a countdown timer at the 5-minute mark of remaining session time.</p>
