        <h1>Application Level Multifactor Authentication</h1>
        <p>You can configure multifactor authentication (MFA) at the application level. By adding MFA to an application, you provide an additional layer of security for specific apps. The end users you assign the app to must respond to additional authentication factors to access the app.</p>
        <p>You can configure app-level MFA by itself or both org-level MFA and app-level MFA together. Refer to <a href="MFA.htm">Multifactor Authentication</a> for more information on org-level MFA. If you configure both, your end users are asked for the additional authentication factors when they sign into Okta and again when they sign into apps that you have configured for app-level MFA.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you have both org-level MFA and app-level MFA configured, and you are prompted for MFA when you sign into your org, there is a grace period of 15 minutes before you are prompted for MFA again. For example, if you are prompted for MFA when you sign into your org and then you start an app that is configured for app-level MFA within 15 minutes, you are not prompted for MFA again.</p>
        <p>To configure app-level MFA, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">From your Administrator Dashboard, select <b>Applications</b> and select the app you want to configure.</li>
            <li value="2">Click the <b>Sign On</b> tab and scroll down to the <b>Sign On Policy</b> section.</li>
            <li value="3">You can either create a new rule or modify an existing one to set up MFA on the app. Select either <b>Add Rule</b> to create a new rule or select the edit rule <b>pencil</b> icon  in the <b>Action</b> column for the rule you want to modify. The <b>App Sign On Rule</b> dialog box appears.</li>
            <li value="4">
                <p><i>(Optional)</i> To configure MFA for specific groups and users, go to the <b>Conditions</b> section and under the question, "Who does this rule apply to?" select <b>The following groups and users</b> checkbox. After you select this checkbox, you can enter the names of the groups and users you want to include.</p>
                <p>In addition, you can select the <b>Exclude the following users and groups from this rule</b> checkbox to exclude groups and users. After you select this checkbox, you can enter the groups and users that you want to exclude from the rule.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">If you have not configured your factor types yet, right click the <b>Multifactor Authentication</b> link and open the page in a new tab or window. After you configure your factor types, close the tab or window and return to this page. If you have already configured your factor types, proceed to the following step.</li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Scroll down to the <b>Actions</b> section. Under <b>Access</b>, select <b>Allowed with multifactor</b>, select when your end users must provide the additional factors, and then click the <b>Save</b> button.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/App_MFA_2.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>About End-User Sign On</h4>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The next time your end users attempt to launch an app that has app-level MFA, they are prompted to set up their extra verification information for the additional factors you configured if they have not already done so. For example, if you configured SMS as an additional factor, end users must provide a mobile number at which they can receive SMS text messages. If they have already configured their extra verification settings, they are only prompted to provide the additional authentication factors to obtain access to the app.</span>
