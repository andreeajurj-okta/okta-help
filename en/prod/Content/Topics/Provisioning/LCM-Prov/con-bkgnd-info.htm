When they log in with single sign-on, their account is automatically created for them, eliminating the time and effort with on-boarding the account. Just-in-Time provisioning works with your SAML identity provider to pass the correct user information to Salesforce in a SAML 2.0 assertion. You can both create and modify accounts this way.

Here's how SAML works through Okta:

SP-initiated flow: the end user requests (principally through a browser) a service from the SP. The SP requests and obtains an identity assertion from the IdP (in this case, Okta). On the basis of this assertion, the SP can decide whether or not to authorize or authenticate the service for the end user.
IdP-initiated flow: with Okta as the IdP, an end user goes to the Okta browser and clicks on a chiclet, sending a SAMLResponse to the configured SP. A session is established with the SP, and the end user is authenticated.</span></a>.</p>

                                                        <p>As employees leave an organization, a process can be initiated by various departments to deactivate users. The user account needs to be deactivated. Deprovisioning deactivates the user account from the Okta Universal Directory. Deprovisioning ensures that persons who are no longer in your organization do not have access to sensitive applications and data. </p>
                                                        <p>You can deprovision users in Okta or from an external user store, such as AD or a CRM app, such as Salesforce. Typically, user deactivation is triggered from an external user store and it flows into Okta. In any case, deactivated users are automatically deprovisioned from supported apps. Admins receive an email describing any apps that require them to manually deprovision from users.</p>
