        <h1>Reports</h1>
        <p>The Reports page displays report data that details how your end users leverage their Okta accounts. Data includes information such as app usage and access, deprovisioning details, and the exposure of suspicious activity, including OpenID Connect events.</p>
        <p>In addition to the generated reports, there are several <a href="Reports_SysLog.htm">System Log</a> queries available.</p>
        <h2>Running Reports</h2>
        <p>To run any report, click the report name, enter the parameters at the top of the screen, and finally click <b>Run Report</b>. After running a report, click the <b>Download CSV</b> link to obtain a cvs version.</p>
        <h2>Available Reports</h2>
        <p>The following reports are available from this page.</p>
        <h4>Okta Usage</h4>
        <p>The Okta Usage report contains data about who has signed into Okta during a specified time range.</p>
        <h4>Okta Password Health</h4>
        <p>The Okta Password Health report produces a CSV-formatted file that shows the user, login, status, activation date, authentication source, last login, and last password change. The authentication source can be Okta, AD, or LDAP. To create the file, click the <b>Okta Password Health</b> link.</p>
        <p>You can user this report to monitor the progress of a password change request that you issue to your Okta end users. For more information, see Password Reset for Okta Mastered Users.</p>
        <h4>Application Usage</h4>
        <p>The Application Usage report contains data about how much an application is being used by user/group over a specified time range. To run the report, click the report name.</p>
        <h4>Application Access &amp; Security</h4>
        <p>This section provides reporting on which applications each user had access to during a specified time period. It differs from Application Usage in that "Usage" shows how much an application is being used during a given period of time. This report now includes the last sign in and last password change information.</p>
        <p>Note: In a SWA app in which the user sets the username and password, the last login time and last app password reset are not captured if the user goes directly into the app.</p>
        <p>The Applications Access &amp; Security section contrains the following three reports: App Access, App Password Health, and SAML Capable Apps.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><b>App Access</b>
                </p>
                <p>The App Access report contains data about how an application is being used over a specified time range.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><b>App Password Health</b>
                </p>
                <p>The App Password Health Report opens a page that allows admins who have the proper permissions to view apps to evaluate their app password health and act on it by asking users to reset their application passwords.</p>
                <div class="MCDropDown">
                    <div class="MCDropDownHead_0"><a class="MCDropDownHotSpot_0" href="javascript:void(0);" id="MCDropDownHotSpot_3588159_0" onclick="FMCDropDown( this ); return false;"><img style="border: none;margin-right: 5px;" src="../../SkinSupport/DropDownClosed.gif" MadCap:altsrc="../../SkinSupport/DropDownOpen.gif" onload="if ( typeof( FMCPreloadImage ) == 'function' ) { FMCPreloadImage( '../../SkinSupport/DropDownOpen.gif' ); }" alt="Closed" MadCap:alt2="Open" class="MCDropDownIcon" />App Password Health Report Details</a>
                    </div>
                    <div class="MCDropDownBody" id="MCDropDownBody_3588159_0" style="display: none;">
                        <p>The App Password Health page allows admins who have the proper permissions to view apps to evaluate their app password health and act on it by providing</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li value="1">The number of end-users using a given app</li>
                            <li value="2">The elapsed time since the last time you requested a password change for this app</li>
                            <li value="3">Quick communication to end-users from a push of the Ask user to reset button</li>
                            <li value="4">A CSV report to track end-user compliance by showing the latest time an end user logged into an app, and the last time the user updated the app password in Okta</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Not all apps will appear on this page. Only your SWA apps that are active, have at least one user or group assigned to them, and where you selected "User sets username and password" in the app setup, appear in this list.</p>
                        <h4>The Ask Users to Reset Button</h4>
                        <p>When you click the <b>Ask Users to Reset</b> button, users are sent a request to update their passwords for the appropriate app(s). This notification comes in the form of a banner on their Home page, as shown below.</p>
                        <p>
                            <img src="../../Resources/Images/App_Health_Report_1.jpeg" />
                        </p>
                        <p>The banner appears the next time your end-users sign into Okta. Once viewed, end-users can easily remove the banner, and it does not reappear unless another password reset is requested.</p>
                        <h4>The CSV Report Button</h4>
                        <p>Click the CSV report button to download a report that details the users of the app, the last known login to this app, and the last time they updated the app password in Okta. View this report to monitor users who have complied with the request, and those who have yet to change their app passwords.</p>
                        <p><b>Note:</b> The values in this report only apply to users who use SSO through Okta to sign into the app. Users who sign into the app directly are not tracked.</p>
                        <h4>The CSV Report of All Password Resets Button</h4>
                        <p>This report is a composite of the <b>Ask users to reset button</b> and the <b>CSV report</b> button.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><b>SAML Capable Apps</b>
                </p>
                <p>You can review all your apps to see if you have any opportunities to convert existing SWA apps to SAML. The SAML Capable Apps report opens a page that shows all apps that you can convert from SWA to SAML. The page has a button for each app take you to the app to begin the process.</p>
                <p>Because end users sign in to SAML apps by signing into Okta, app passwords are not required. This reduces this risk of an app being compromised. It's also more convenient for your end users, since they don't need to manage the app passwords.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>MFA Usage</h4>
        <p>The MFA Usage report details Multifactor Authentication status and usage. This report shows all the MFA factors in Okta and the usage, by user. A user can have multiple entries in this report, if that user has many MFA factors configured. You can run the report for all users or for a single user. If you do not enter a user, selecting Run Report generates the report for all users. </p>
        <h4>Suspicious Activity</h4>
        <p>The Suspicious Activity report contains data about suspicious events such as failed logins and locked out users over a specified time range. The report includes information about the time, login (user), client IP (user computer), and type of suspicious event that occurred.</p>
        <h4>Deprovision Details</h4>
        <p>The Deprovision Details report contains data about all assignments that have been deprovisioned over a specified time range.</p>
        <h4>SMS Usage</h4>
        <p>The SMS Usage report contains data about the SMS usage for the org.</p>
