                            <h1>Access Request Workflow</h1>
                            <p class="earlyaccess"><span class="MyVariablesEarlyAccess">(Undefined variable: MyVariables.EarlyAccess)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>The Access Request Workflow feature is a complete, multi-step approval workflow through which end users can request access to apps. Admins can select approvers who have the ability to grant access for self-service applications.</p>
                            <p>This feature enhances Okta's provisioning solution, which is largely used by IT teams to automate account provisioning and SSO access for users on their first day of employment. Later, users regularly need access to job-specific applications that are often beyond an IT team's purview. With this feature, business application owners, rather than IT, can grant access and assign entitlements in apps that need them.</p>
                            <p>Access Request Workflow features group and individual approvers, customized notifications, commenting, notes, and customizable timeout rules. All setup is accessed from the Okta Admin Dashboard and requires no programming or configuration files.</p>
                            <h2>End User Experience</h2>
                            <p>When an end user clicks Add Apps, a list of apps is shown. Apps that do not require approval have an Add button, and apps that do require approval have a Request button. When the end users click a request button, a window opens to confirm the request. End users can enter an optional message to the approvers up to 1,000 characters. A message appears when they confirm the request and the Request button changes to Requested. During the approval process, end users receive the messages and email notifications that you configure.</p>
                            <h2>Approver Experience</h2>
                            <p>After the end user requests an app, the first approver receives an email containing the request and a link. Following the link gives options to approve or deny the request.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li value="1">If you approve the request and you are the first approver in a chain, the next approver receives the email message.</li>
                                <li value="2">If you approve the request and you are the final or only approver, the user is provisioned to the app and receives SSO access if the app is configured for provisioning; otherwise, the users is assigned to the app and receives SSO Access.</li>
                                <li value="3">If you deny the request, the user is not granted access and the system log is updated.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In all cases, only the messages you enable in the setup are sent.</p>
                            <p>As an approver, you can check outstanding approvals in your queue at any time. From the Okta Home Page, select the down arrow next to your user name and then select <b>Tasks</b>. All open tasks display, and you can process any approvals from the list that displays.</p>
                            <h2>Group Approver Experience</h2>
                            <p>If a group is specified as an approver, all members of the group receive email notifications and are asked to approve the request. When one member of the group approves or rejects the request, the step is complete, and the task is removed from all the other group members' queues.</p>
                            <h2>Admin Experience</h2>
                            <p>After the approval is setup and after an end user requests an app, Okta Admins can intervene in this approval process and perform any of the following actions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li value="1">View outstanding requests and see the current step of the approval process.</li>
                                <li value="2">Resend approval notifications to the current approver.</li>
                                <li value="3">Cancel an outstanding request.</li>
                                <li value="4">Override this process and assign the app to an end user immediately.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>To view, resend, or cancel a request, navigate to <b>Applications &gt; Applications</b> and select the <b>People</b> subtab. After an app is requested, there is a Manage Requests button on the right, below the self-service configure option. Click this button to open the Manage Application Requests window. The following actions are available.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li value="1">Click the <b>&gt;</b> icon to view the request history.</li>
                                <li value="2">Click the paper airplane icon to resend the request.</li>
                                <li value="3">Click the trash can icon to delete the request.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Note:</b> If you override this approval process and assign the app immediately, the approval process stops. The end user has access to the app, and any existing workflow is deleted.</p>
                            <p>Admin Best Practices</p>
                            <p>Certain Admin actions can have an adverse effect on Access Request Workflows. Performing any of the following actions can cause issues with existing and subsequent access requests.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li value="1">Deactivating the app</li>
                                <li value="2">Deactivating an approver</li>
                                <li value="3">Deleting a group specified as a group approver</li>
                                <li value="4">Modifying the schema of an app</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Before making any of these changes to applications or approvers, take action on any affected requests that are pending and then, disable approval for the app. After the changes are made you can enable approvals for the app again.</p>
                            <h2>Admin Setup</h2>
                            <p>There are two parts to setting up an app to use this workflow. First, configure the app for self service. Then, configure the approval workflow.</p>
                            <h3>Configure the App for Self Service</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li value="1">Navigate to <b>Applications &gt; Self Service</b>.</li>
                                <li value="2"><b>Edit</b> the <em>Permissions</em> as needed to ensure <b>Enable self service application assignment</b> is checked.</li>
                                <li value="3">Ensure that either <b>Show organization and user managed apps</b> or <b>Show organization managed apps only</b> is checked</li>
                                <li value="4">Enter the display options, as desired.</li>
                                <li value="5">Make sure you have completed all steps in adding the app.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Configure the App Approval Workflow</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li value="1">Navigate to <b>Applications &gt; Applications</b> and select the name of the app.</li>
                                <li value="2">Navigate to the <b>People</b> subtab, as shown below.
			<p><img src="../../Resources/Images/App_Approval_1.png" /></p><p><b>Note:</b> This tab is <u>not</u> the <em>Assign to People</em> link in the app setup.</p></li>
                                <li value="3">Click Configure in the sidebar that appears on the right. If the self service window is not visible, check the provisioning setup for the app.</li>
                                <li value="4">
                                    <p>Check the options you want for the approval flow.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">Approval â€“ Required or Not Required. You can configure approval and then make it required later.</li>
                                        <li value="2">Note for requester â€“ Use this field to provide a description of the app or instructions for the requester. The maximum length is 500 characters.</li>
                                        <li value="3">Send app requests to â€“ Specify the individual or group that should receive the app requests.
						<p>To specify an individual, begin typing the individuals name. A list of matches appear from which you can select.</p><p>To specify a group, change the dropdown to Group and then type the group name. Groups specified as approvers cannot contain more than 100 members.</p><p>You can specify multiple individuals or groups to create an approval chain. An approval chain is limited to 10 approvers.You cannot enter the same individual or group more than once.</p><p>Entitlements specify the action the approver can perform on the requester's account. There are three choices.</p><ul><li value="1">Hidden â€“ approver cannot view user's account attributes</li><li value="2">Read â€“ approver can view, but not modify account attributes</li><li value="3">Write â€“ approver can edit the requester's account attributes</li></ul><p>Best Practice: Set up the approval chain to satisfy provisioning requirements.</p><ul><li value="1">If the app supports provisioning and has required attributes that need to be specified during assignment, then at least one of the approvers needs to be able to edit and set these user attributes.</li><li value="2">If the app does not support automated provisioning, the final approval step can also serve as the provisioning step. Select an admin who can provision the application account as the final approver. This admin can provision the account and then approve the request to give the end user immediate SSO access to the app.</li></ul><p>Note: To change the order of the approvers, click and hold the dotted handle to the left of the approver's step number and drag the line to the desired location.</p></li>
                                        <li value="4">If request is approved â€“ Specify any actions in addition to the notice the requester received when the app is added to the Okta dashboard. If you choose Send email to others, you are prompted for an email address.</li>
                                        <li value="5">Approver must respond within â€“ Specify the time each approver has to respond to the request. You can specify 1 week, 30 days, or a custom time period. If you choose a custom time period, you are prompted to choose a number of weeks or days.
						<ul><li value="1">When a request times out, Okta cancels the request. Okta does not grant the user access to the requested app. Requests that time out are marked differently in the Okta logs than requests that are explicitly denied.</li><li value="2">The configurable timeout applies to each step in the approval chain. For example, if an admin chooses 1 week for the approval time, each approver is given a week to respond, if there are multiple approvers. If there are three approvers, the total chain could potentially take three weeks to approve.</li></ul><p>Timeouts can be used to define a service-level agreement (SLA) for requests and handle situations in which an approver is not available for reasons such as leave or vacation.). Okta recommends notifying you help organization about timeouts so they can follow up with the requester and manually fulfill the request if needed.</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li value="5">If you have not set the app to show in the self-service settings, the following message appears after you click <b>Save</b>. Follow the link to edit the settings and check the <em>Show</em> column for the app.
