Admins can designate approvers to grant users access for self-service applications.\n\nThis feature enhances Okta\u0027s provisioning solution, which typically is used by IT teams to automate account provisioning and SSO access for users on their first day of employment. Later, users need access to job-specific applications that are often beyond an IT team\u0027s purview. The Access Request Workflow feature allows business application owners — rather than IT — to grant users access to apps and assign entitlements in apps that require them.',l:''},'ACS URL':{d:'ACS Endpoint – Assertion Consumer Service URL – often referred to simply as the SP login URL.

This is the individual(s) who have access to the Okta Administrator Dashboard. They control the provisioning and deprovisioning of end users, the assigning of apps, the resetting of passwords, and the overall end user experience. Only administrators have the Administration button on the upper right side of the My Applications page.',l:''},'Agent':{d:'A software agent is a lightweight program that runs as a service outside of Okta. It is typically installed behind a firewall and allows Okta to tunnel communication between an on-premises service and Okta\u0027s cloud service. Okta employs several agent types: Active Directory, LDAP, RADIUS, RSA, Active Directory Password Sync, and IWA. For example, users can install multiple Active Directory agents to ensure that the integration is robust and highly available across geographic locations.',l:''},'App':{d:'An abbreviation of application. Essentially, it is a web-based site used to perform any number of specific tasks, and requires authentication from end users by signing in.',l:''},'App admin':{d:'An app admin can be granted access to all instances of an app, or just specific instances of that application. This allows for more granular access control.',l:''},'Authentication':{d:'Authentication is distinct from authorization, which is the process of giving individuals access to system objects based on their identity.

This eliminates the need to create user accounts in advance. For example, if you recently added an employee to your organization, you don\u0027t need to manually create the user in Salesforce. When they log in with single sign-on, their account is automatically created for them, eliminating the time and effort with on-boarding the account. Just-in-Time provisioning works with your SAML identity provider to pass the correct user information to Salesforce in a SAML 2.0 assertion. You can both create and modify accounts this way. Because Just-in-Time provisioning uses SAML to communicate, your organization must have SAML-based single sign-on enabled.',l:''},'Kerberos':{d:'Kerberos is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner.',l:''},'LDAP':{d:'Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a lightweight client-server protocol for accessing directory services, specifically X.500-based directory services.

When a profile is mastered from a given resource (application or directory), the profile attributes of an Okta user is derived exclusively from that resource and therefore cannot be edited in Okta. For example, an Active Directory mastered Okta user has an Okta profile. However, that profile is not editable in Okta by the user or administrator and derives its information exclusively from Active Directory.  \n\nOkta has implemented a more granular version of this concept, where mastery can be applied at the attribute level, rather than only at the whole profile level. This permits an Okta user profile to derive portions of its attributes from multiple different masters. See the Attribute Level Mastering document for more information.',l:''},'My Applications Page':{d:'This is the central home page for Okta users.

OMM enables you to manage your users\u0027 mobile devices, applications, and data. Your users enroll in the service and can then download and use managed apps from the Apps Store.

A user can only be mastered by a single application or directory at any one time. For more details, see the Profile Master page.\n\nWhen users are mastered by attribute, we call this attribute-level mastery (ALM). ALM delivers finer grain control over how profiles are mastered by allowing admins to specify different profile masters for individual attributes. Profile mastering only applies to Okta user profiles, not app user profiles. For more details, see Attribute Level Mastering.',l:''},'Profile mastering':{d:'Mastering is a more sophisticated version of read (import) users. Mastering defines the flow and maintenance of user-object attributes and their lifecycle state. When a profile is mastered from a given resource (application or directory), the Okta user profile’s attributes and lifecycle state are derived exclusively from that resource. In other words, an Okta user mastered by Active Directory (or HR system) has an Okta profile. However, the profile isn’t editable in Okta by the user or Okta admin, and derives its information exclusively from Active Directory. If the lifecycle state of the user in Active Directory moves to Disabled, the linked Okta user also switches to the corresponding lifecycle state of Deactivated on the next the read (import).',l:''},'Provisioning':{d:'Provisioning is the enterprise-wide configuration, deployment, and management of multiple types of IT system resources.

The SAML standard addresses issues unique to the single sign-on (SSO) solution, and defines three roles: the end user, the IdP, and the SP.\n\nHere\u0027s how SAML works through Okta:\n\nSP-initiated flow: the end user requests (principally through a browser) a service from the SP. The SP requests and obtains an identity assertion from the IdP (in this case, Okta). On the basis of this assertion, the SP can decide whether or not to authorize or authenticate the service for the end user.\nIdP-initiated flow: with Okta as the IdP, an end user goes to the Okta browser and clicks on an app, sending a SAMLResponse to the configured SP. A session is established with the SP, and the end user is authenticated.',l:''},'Schema Discovery':{d:'Ability to import additional attributes to Okta',l:''},'SCIM':{d:'System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning. It was created in 2011 as it became clear that the technology of the future would be cloud-based.

In a SSO system, a user logs in once to the system and can access multiple systems without being prompted to sign in for each one. Okta is a cloud-based SSO platform that allows users to enter one name and password to access multiple applications. Users can access all of their web applications, both behind the firewall and in the cloud, with a single sign in. Okta provides a seamless experience across PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.',l:''},'Super admin':{d:'The super admin receives full access to every item in the Administrative Console and is the only role that can assign administrator roles to other user accounts.
