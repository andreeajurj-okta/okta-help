Okta policies allow control of various elements of security, including end-user passwords, the authentication challenges a user receives, the devices they can use, and the places they use them from. A policy can be based on a variety of factors, such as location, group definitions, and authentication type.</p>

                                                <p>Group password policies allow you to define password policies and associated rules to enforce password settings on the group and authentication-provider level.

It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. Initially, Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management.</span></a> password policies don't conflict with the Okta policies. Passwords for AD-mastered users are still managed by the directory service. Some applications, such as Microsoft Office 365 and Google G&#160;Suite, check an Okta password policy when provisioning a user to ensure that the Okta policy meets the application's password requirements. </p>
                                                <p>It is sometimes possible for a user's Okta password to meet these requirements while the password policy itself does not, which results in an error during the provisioning attempt. If you observe provisioning errors after configuring or editing an Okta password policy, ensure that it meets the application's requirements, typically, eight characters with an upper and lower case character and either a symbol or number.</p>

						<ul><li value="1"><b>Minimum length</b> – Specify a minimum password length of four to 30 characters (the default value is eight).<p> <b>Note</b>: The maximum length for a password is 72 characters. You cannot change the maximum length.</p></li><li value="2"><b>Common password check</b> – Check <em>Restrict use of common passwords</em> to ensure that passwords are not too weak based on a list of the most commonly used passwords.</li><li value="3"><b>Complexity requirements</b> – Complex passwords increase the security of your users' accounts. Choose any or all of the items in the list to define the level of complexity that is required for your users. </li><li value="4"><b>Password age</b> – Specifies how often users must change their passwords and prevents them from reusing the same passwords within a specified period of time. Setting the password age does not set how long a password is valid for a session.

								<ul><li value="1"><b>Password history</b> enforces the number of passwords that must be different before your users can reuse a password. You can specify from 1–24 passwords. </li><li value="2">Minimum password age enforces the minimum time interval required between password changes.

Users are warned five days before the expiration date that their passwords are going to expire. They can change their password when the warning appears or wait until the expiration date. After a password expires, users must change their passwords to sign into Okta. You can configure this setting for 1–999 days. Note that users do not receive an expiration warning if this field is set to less than six days.

					<p><b>Note:</b> Password expiration cannot be accurately calculated for users created before March 10, 2014.

The minimum setting is one minute. The user password remains unchanged when the account is unlocked.

								<p><b>Important:</b> To allow users to receive SMS messages as part of the self-service unlock process, you must enable <b>Allow SMS</b> for self-service operations in the <b>Organization</b> section shown below, in addition to configuring  self-service unlock in this section.</p></li><li value="3"><a name="SendLockoutEmail"></a><b>Send lockout email to user</b> — Select to send locked-out users an email if their account is locked due to too many failed sign-in attempts.

This policy reflects the MFA settings that were in place when you enabled your sign-on policy, and ensures that no changes in MFA behavior occur unless you modify your policy. If needed, you can delete it.</p>

                                                        <p>Okta amalgamates the conditions of a policy and the conditions of a rule to determine whether a policy is applied to a particular user. Policies generally consist of large elements that can be applied to many users, such as a minimum password length. Rules consist of conditions such as place and circumstance, like geographical location or whether the user is on or off a company network. A policy that contains no rules cannot be applied.

</p>
                                                        <p>For example, if you create a policy which you assign to the group “Admins”, you would create conditions special to the needs of administrators. The policy might contain a minimum password length of 12 to restrict password hacking. An applied rule to the policy might be one that allows for a self-service unlock only under certain conditions. One condition might be whether a particular admin is off or on your company network.</p>

    A policy that contains no rules cannot be successfully applied—a warning will indicate that no rules exist for this policy.
