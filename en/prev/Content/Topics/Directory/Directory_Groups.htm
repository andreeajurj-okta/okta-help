                                                <h3>Native Okta Groups</h3>
                                                <p>Before you connect Okta to anything, you can create groups in your Okta organization.

A company that uses Okta as their SSO portal is generally referred to as an org. As an administrator, you decide how Okta should be displayed and/or integrated with your org.</span></a>.</p>
                                                <p>To manage your Okta groups, sign into your <strong>Administrator Dashboard</strong> and select <strong>Directory</strong> &gt; <strong>Groups</strong>.</p>
                                                <h3>Active Directory Groups</h3>
                                                <p>The most common source of groups is Active Directory. Nearly every business of significant size uses Active Directory in some form.

It is typically installed behind a firewall and allows Okta to tunnel communication between an on-premises service and Okta's cloud service. Okta employs several agent types: Active Directory, LDAP, RADIUS, RSA, Active Directory Password Sync, and IWA. For example, users can install multiple Active Directory agents to ensure that the integration is robust and highly available across geographic locations.</span></a>. </p>

                                                <p>Okta can import groups from LDAP-compliant servers through a Java LDAP agent that runs on both Windows and Unix.

                                                <h3>About Group Imports</h3>
                                                <p>The AD agent imports groups differently depending on how your org is configured. After you install your first AD agent, you can specify the OUs that you want to connect Okta, and then run either an incremental or full import.</p>

                                                <h3 class="p5">About Nested Groups</h3>
                                                <p>Many directory systems and applications support the concept of nested groups (or groups in groups). Okta does not currently support nested groups. Okta extracts all nested directories for group members and adds them all to a single parent group in Okta. See the example below in which the group in AD on the left has two groups as child members, and the resultant group in Okta on the right.</p>

                                                <p>In Active Directory, a universal security group (USG) allows for membership across all trusted forests in an AD environment. By default, USGs only exist in Okta if there is an AD agent in a domain importing users and groups. Enabling the <span class="s1"><b>Universal Security Group</b> (USG) option ignores domain boundaries when importing group memberships for your users. This assumes that the relevant domains are connected in Okta</span>.</p>
                                                <p>
                                                    <img alt="User-added image" src="../../Resources/Images/Groups_1b_500x58.png" style="width: 500;height: 58;" />
                                                </p>
                                                <p>You must also deploy an AD agent for every domain in your forest that contains the USG object that you want to sync with Okta. Each connected domain then imports its groups. When a user's group memberships match any groups that were imported (from any connected domain in the forest), Okta syncs the memberships for the user to each group. This option provides greater control of group imports from on-premises apps to Okta. Only groups from connected domains are imported.</p>
                                                <p>For details about USG import scenarios, see <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/FAQ-Okta-and-AD-Groups" target="_blank">FAQ: Okta and AD Groups</a>​​.</p>
                                                <h3>Importing Groups from Applications with Provisioning</h3>
                                                <p>You can import groups from applications that have provisioning enabled. If you set up an import schedule for the app, it also imports new groups that you add and makes membership changes to existing ones. If you only want to import groups, set up provisioning but do not configure any user options. You cannot edit the memberships of these imported groups. </p>
                                                <h3>Confirming Your Group Imports</h3>
                                                <p>After you configure provisioning on an app that supports groups, Okta automatically imports groups from that app. Sign into your <strong>Administrator Dashboard</strong> and select <strong>Directory </strong>&gt;<strong> Groups</strong> to see newly imported groups. You can also select <strong>Reports</strong> &gt; <strong>System Log</strong>, and then select the <strong>Application Imports (Summary)</strong> report to see new groups that have been imported.</p>
                                                <p>Following a successful import, under specific conditions Okta automatically sends an email to designated administrators. The email details the number of users and groups scanned, added, updated, and/or removed during the import. Okta only sends the email if the scan detects any new users or groups, or changes to any existing user profile or group membership.</p>
                                                <h3>About Duplicate Groups in Microsoft Office 365</h3>
                                                <p>If your application also imports groups from Active Directory (for example, Office 365 via DirSync), you might have duplicate groups in Okta if you have enabled provisioning on the app. This happens under the following conditions:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li value="1">You have two or more Active Directory forests. For example, forestA and forestZ.</li>
                                                    <li value="2">Microsoft DirSync is configured on forestA to synchronize all groups from the forest into an Office 365 (Azure AD) instance.</li>
                                                    <li value="3">Your Okta AD agent is configured to import users and groups from both forestA and forestZ into an Okta org.</li>
                                                    <li value="4">Okta is configured for provisioning with users from forestZ to the same Office 365 tenant.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p>When you configure provisioning on the forestZ Office 365 app, it automatically imports groups from Office 365 into Okta. There are groups in Office 365 that are imported from forestA that already exist in Okta because of a sync from the forestA AD agent. The image below shows a mix of groups from Box, LDAP, and Active Directory alongside native groups in Okta.</p>

                                                <p>Assigning applications is one of the main uses of groups. You can assign users to an application manually, person by person (see <a href="Directory_People.htm">People</a> for more details), but this does not scale well when you have a large number of users. You can create groups directly in Okta but then you must also manage those groups in Okta. Most admins already have groups in their corporate directories (for example, in Active Directory or an LDAP server) that have existing group management processes to keep them up to date.</p>
                                                <p>It makes sense to use these groups for application assignment purposes.</p>
                                                <p>You can either select a group, then assign applications to that group; or you can select an application, then assign that application to one or more groups. Both methods are described below.</p>

                                                <h3>Prioritizing Groups</h3>
                                                <p>When you assign a group to an application, there might be information in the target application that you want to assign to the user. For example, in Salesforce there is <strong>Profile</strong> and <strong>Role</strong> data. When a user is a member of more than one group assigned to the application, it might be confusing which Profile and Role they get. Group priority determines this.</p>
                                                <p>To set group priority:</p>

                                                <p>You can use<strong> App Sign On Rules</strong> to deny access to apps if users are not accessing them from a particular network location, or enforce the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA). When you define an app sign on rule, you can limit its scope to a group. You can configure policies to implement MFA for remote, temporary, or contract employees.</p>
                                                <p>You can also use this feature to exclude groups. This feature is useful to allow a small group of users to access apps from anywhere, but we recommend that generally users should be on your corporate network.</p>

                                                <h3>Using Okta Groups in Applications and Directories</h3>
                                                <p>Okta enables you to define group membership in one directory and then use your groups in multiple connected systems. In on-premises systems, applications can connect to and query for groups from a central directory. Cloud apps often lack a common Active Directory, so you must use a different approach to use groups with multiple applications. Okta uses a feature called push groups to make this happen.</p>

                                                <p>You can push groups from Okta to other connected applications and directories such as Box and Active Directory. The current list of apps to which you can push groups includes the following:</p>

The SAML standard addresses issues unique to the single sign-on (SSO) solution, and defines three roles: the end user, the IDP, and the SP.</span></a> sign-on process. This works well when you want to do the following:</p>
                                                <ul>

                                                </ul>
                                                <p>Essentially there is no provisioning configuration. Group information is sent in the SAML assertion when the user signs into a target app. This is less flexible than group push, in which you must use regular expressions to filter the groups you want. The advantage of this method is that it is available as part of the SAML template. If your target application accepts group information by SAML, you can configure a template without requiring an engineering effort to implement group push.

                                                <p>The following sections provide examples of how groups can be used across Okta.</p>
                                                <h3>Provisioning Users in Target Applications</h3>
                                                <p>Applications that support provisioning can use group membership to determine which user accounts are created, updated, and deleted or deactivated. After you have configured provisioning, assign a group to your application. Members of the group are automatically created in the target app.</p>
                                                <p>Some services have additional data that you can assign to a newly created user. For example, when you assign a group to a Salesforce application with provisioning enabled, you can choose the Salesforce roles and profiles that are assigned to users in the group.</p>
                                                <h3>Assigning the Everyone Group to Provide Office 365 Access</h3>
                                                <p>All employees in a company must have access to Office 365. The company has multiple Active Directory domains that are being imported and therefore it makes sense to assign the Okta <strong>Everyone</strong> group to the Office 365 application.</p>
                                                <h3>Mapping Active Directory Groups to Box Folders</h3>
                                                <p>A company uses AD groups to control access to files and they are migrating to Box for file sharing. Folders are set up in Box that reflect the same or a similar hierarchy to the on-premises file server. Import groups into Okta and then push them to Box where they can be assigned to Collaboration Folders.</p>
