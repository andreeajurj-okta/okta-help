In a SSO system, a user logs in once to the system and can access multiple systems without being prompted to sign in for each one. Okta is a cloud-based SSO platform that allows users to enter one name and password to access multiple applications. Users can access all of their web applications, both behind the firewall and in the cloud, with a single sign in. Okta provides a seamless experience across PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.</span></a> access to cloud, on-premise, and mobile applications. You sign into Okta and you can then launch any of your web apps without having to reenter your credentials. Okta establishes a secure connection with a user's browser and then authenticates the user to Okta-managed apps using one of two SSO integration methods:</p>
                                    <ul>

SWA is a SSO system developed by Okta to provide single sign-on for apps that don't support proprietary federated sign-on methods or SAML. Users can enter their credentials for these apps on their homepage. These credentials are stored such that users can access their apps without entering their credentials each time. When users first sign-in to a SWA app from their homepage, they see a pop-up message asking if they were able to sign-in successfully.</span></a>)</li>

                                    <p>Okta provides access to cloud apps with the Okta Application Network (<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">OAN<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>An acronym for the Okta Application Network. The OAN is comprised of thousands of public, pre-integrated business and consumer applications. As an on-demand service, OAN integrations are continuously validated, always up to date, and constantly growing both in number and capability. Okta performs a single integration with an ISV or SP, providing thousands of end users with point-and-click customization for their orgs.</span></a>), a collection of thousands of supported applications. SSO protocols and provisioning APIs are maintained by Okta. The applications in the OAN can use SWA, SAML or OpenID, or proprietary APIs.</p>
                                    <p>Okta also provides integrations for on-premise web-based applications. You can integrate on-premise apps using SWA for SSO, SAML toolkits, and support for provisioning and de-provisioning into applications that expose provisioning APIs publicly.</p>
                                    <p>Okta provides integrations for mobile apps whether they are HTML5 web apps optimized for mobile platforms, Native iOS, or Android apps. You can access any web application in the OAN with SSO from any mobile device. Mobile web apps can use industry-standard SAML or Okta's SWA SSO technology. Native applications like Box Mobile can be integrated using SAML authentication for registration and OAuth for ongoing usage.</p>

                                    <h2>About SAML Apps</h2>
                                    <p>Okta provides integration toolkits to enable apps that are not in the OAN to support SAML. You can obtain SAML integration toolkits for .NET, Java, and PHP platforms. </p>
                                    <h2>SSO for Active Directory-Authenticated Web Apps</h2>
                                    <p class="p1">You can integrate on-premise web apps with Okta. On-premises web apps that use Active Directory (AD) credentials for authentication do not use Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), but instead require users to enter their AD credentials when they sign in on a browser. When you configure Okta to delegate authentication to AD, signing in to internal web apps can also be automated. </p>
                                    <p>Here's how Okta enables SSO for AD-authenticated internal web applications:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li value="1">Configure Okta to delegate authentication to AD. </li>
                                        <li value="2">Customer has on-premises apps authenticating to AD. </li>
                                        <li value="3">Users sign in to Okta with AD credentials. </li>
                                        <li value="4">Users access their internal web apps with SWA using AD credentials. </li>
                                        <li value="5">The internal web apps authenticate users against AD. </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Okta uses SWA to automatically sign users in to internal web apps. When you configure an internal web application to delegate authentication to AD (the same source to which Okta delegates authentication), Okta captures the user's AD password during the sign-in process and automatically sets that password for that user in any applications that also delegate to AD. This enables users to click a link to access these apps, and then sign in automatically. Okta synchronizes the AD password securely. If the password is later changed in AD, the change is captured when the user signs in to Okta, which immediately updates in the secure password store for that app, ensuring that the next sign-in attempt is successful.</p>
                                    <h2>About Template Apps</h2>
                                    <p>There are two common SWA template apps that you can use to create apps on demand - one that does a POST to a sign-in page (the <strong>Template App</strong>) and one that uses a plugin to POST (the <strong>Template Plugin App</strong>). These template apps allow you to create application integrations in real-time on a running system. </p>
                                    <h2>About the Browser Plugin</h2>
                                    <p>The Okta browser plugin enables you to automatically sign into applications that would otherwise require you to manually enter your credentials.

                                    <h2>About Okta Mobile Apps</h2>
                                    <p>Okta Mobile uses SSO to extend its functionality to apps on your iPad or iPhone. The Okta Mobile application provides an embedded Okta browser and app menu. You can download and install the Okta Mobile app from the Apple App store.

                                    <p>You can use the App Integration Wizard to create your own app. The App Integration Wizard allows you to create custom SWA and SAML 2.0 apps.
