Admins can now offer their end users a free Okta Personal account to store personal data, allow them to switch between accounts, and migrate personal apps from Okta enterprise tenant to Okta Personal. When Okta Personal for Workforce is enabled, personalized comms will be sent to the end users encouraging them to use Okta Personal for personal data and Okta enterprise for work data.

Until now, admins couldn't exactly match Okta password complexity requirements to those of their AD instances.

As a result, users were locked out without proper error messages. This feature bridges that gap.

Previously, customizations were limited to 27 Okta-supported languages. This feature allows admins to configure additional locales using Okta’s Brands API. When a new locale is configured, it's available as a new language selection within the <span class="wintitle">Email Templates Editor</span>. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#enable-additional-locales">Customized Email Notifications</a>.

				With Dynamic OS version compliance, Okta updates device assurance policies with the latest OS versions and patches, eliminating the need for manual updates. With this feature you can ensure OS version compliance in your org without tracking OS releases.

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user's email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.
